"We are happy with this purchase. The chair was not difficult to assemble and seems like it will be a nice piece to have as our baby boy grows up. Because it is a toddler rocker, it is a bit wide, so our son ends up tilting a bit to the side since he isn't wide enough for the chair yet and isn't quite strong enough to sit straight on his own. The recline and upright angles aren't very different from each other, but they work just fine.",True
"this stuff has saved my son from severe diaper rash.. For wipes, I use a non-alcholic witch hazel and use cotton balls.. it's really is amazing.. but i wish it came in a bigger tube!",True
"Great, great first toy. I have twins, and this has been a great mat for them to discover new things to do, such as grabbing, feeling, etc. It also helps them immensely with tummy time. Instead of getting frustrated, my girls look at the vibrant colors or the mirror on their tummies while lifting their heads. Fabulous gift!",True
"This is a very handy product to have. It has it's own carry case, which is a great plus. It's perfect for traveling to grandparents or even hotels.",True
"Love the stroller. Bought it because my husabnd is 6'4"" and had problems kicking all other strollers when trying to push. The Peg Perego has a stroller with adjustable handles for a tall/average height couple but it only changes the height a couple inches versus the Maclaren change of three inches. The stroller is lightweight, easy to fold and looks to be comfy. My only complaint is no adult cup holder and when you put one on it usually gets messed up while folding. Not a big deal but worth mentioning. I got mine in red for MUCH less than list price after searching internet. (Really liked the lilac but it was $100 more and I did not think a color was worth that much more money)",True
"I was a little hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews, but my 2 1/2 month old loves it and we haven't had any problems with leakage or anything. The flaps are a little pointless for her, but other than that it's really cool! I think it is absolutely worth the money!",True
"We bought this booster seat for our 4 year old, very slim daughter. Since she weighs 30 pounds I was looking for a very safe seat for her. She LOVES this seat. She feels like such a big kid. After using it for several weeks now, I feel very good about how the seat belt itself is not too high, and the comfort of the seat. She loves to unbuckle it herself when we get to a location and tells me the seat is very comfortable. It has been extremely easy to install and move around when we need to, and I am very happy with this purchase. The only possible negative I can think of is that you have to pay a little more for the girl print. I still don't get that part. She loves the colors, and I love how sturdy it is compared to the other boosters we have used. I would definitely recommend this product to others (and have done so).",True
"We purchased a jumperoo at the advice of friends, as our little one needed to do more than lay on her back or have tummy time while playing. We were glad to have selected the Rainforest Jumperoo--She loves it! She weighs about 20 lbs, so you have to be careful to get her feet through the two footholes. The seat is just right, although I don't know how much longer she will be able to get into and out of it, but it works fine, and she jumps excitedly for long periods of time (not just a 5-minute gig). It's nice for me when I need to do some work in kitchen.My husband wishes they made one for adults...grin!",True
"I bought this pail when I had my second child. I used the Dekor before and decided to try something different. This pail is great. It is very easy to use and doesn't smell at all. At first, my two year old decided to put everything in it because it is so fun to use, but she soon learned that only dirty diapers go in it. The only drawback is the the shoot does get pretty dirty and needs to be cleaned once in a while.",True
"We love this booster seat. It's simple, narrow (a plus for us, as we have three seats that need to fit) and the chest strap holders are attached. Absolutely love this booster!",True
We could not live without this. We traveled a lot with our daughter when she was between 4-10 months and this was essential for carrying her around airports to keep her safe and our hands free.,True
"Great for 18 month old. Cleans easy w/ no seams or crevices to worry about. Lifts up and sets in easily. Love the rubber around the foot print to stop from sliding or ""driving"" potty around tile floor. Very lightweight but doesn't tip over easily when little ones are practicing getting up and down. I have two - one for each floor of the house.",True
"We too, were thinking that we'd later have to use a rental or buy the more expensive pump but ,this one really does the trick. It's awesome, I take it to work with me and I'm able to store the milk right in the case. It's also quiet enough that everyone doesn't have to know when I'm pumping. This is a good buy, don't waste your money on the more expensive pumps.",True
"These bottles frustrated me at first, but once I got them &quot;down pat&quot; they have been great and I think they really do keep the air out and keep gas to a minimum. The early frustrations: the nipple is a little too big for a newborn, although he got the hang of it. The hole in Stage One is too small, even for a newborn, and made him suck WAY too hard..so hard, it left a mark on his upper lip!! So I made the hole a little bigger with a red hot needle tip. The bottom plastic piece (the &quot;vent&quot; piece) is a little tricky to get in place properly -- you really have to dig in there and make sure it's right or the bottom will leak (my husband still can't get this part right)...if the top ring/nipple leaks just pull the nipple up a little and adjust the tension of the ring. Sounds like a lot of work, and feels like a lot of work the first few days home when your starving infant is howling to eat, but once you get into the groove, they are great bottles. Playtex should make a few improvements, and also provide clearer directions with the bottles. I somewhat regret not starting my baby out on the Playtex Nurser Disposable system, though. It's too late now, because he is used to the nipple on the VentAir and wants nothing to do with several versions of the Nurser nipple, including the new silicone version that isn't as &quot;square-like&quot; as the latex nipple.",True
I recieved this pump from my hospital when I had my baby. I have to say I have two electric pumps one medela and one playtex and they all take out milk about the same. I use this pump when my baby is sleeping and I need to pump out some milk. The handle is kind of weird but it works really well.I prefer using the pump without the flexishield.I think any standard bottle screws on to this pump I use my medela bottles on this pump too. I recommend this pump for anyone who wants a easy to use and easy to clean product,True
"I purchased the Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame to use w/ my SnugRide 32 infant car seat. The stroller frame works just like a snap 'n go, is easy to put together and has a large basket just as pictured. It's lightweight and easy to get the car seat in and out of. I know I will get a lot of use out of this item once baby arrives. Amazon had the best price, very quick delivery and no hassles.",True
"This has to be one of the best strollers ever. I have the stroller and matching car seat/carrier as a travel system. Easy open, easy close, and very easy rolling (smooth as roller blades). Grandma is 76 years old and has no problem managing this stroller - she wishes she had strollers that rolled this well for her 4 kids. Lightweight for a full-size stroller. Very durable - still looks new after 16 months. Canopy is great for sun and wind. Large, easy to access basket. Boot is great in winter - throw a warm blanket on their legs under the boot and you don't have to bundle them up like the Stay-Puff marshmallow man. The reversible handles are great when your infant has outgrown the carrier but you still want them to face you in the stroller. New snack tray is a great addition, and as always with Peg Perego, new features can be retrofitted to the older models. Worth every penny.",True
"Beautiful piece of furniture, but my toddler grabbed a drawer on the side and tried to climb up to see in her drawer, and it bent the sliding rods. My husband had to man handle it so it would go back in the dresser. Other than that it's great- fits much more than the set I bought at R2G, and less expensive.",True
"This item is great! I bought this instead of the Bumbo seat for a few reasons.1.) This one came with a tray, toy, and 2 place mats for cheaper than I could have gotten the Bumbo seat with its accessories.2.) I like how when my daughter sits in the BebePod, her legs are comfortably pointing downward instead of straight out like the Bumbo seat.3.) I love the Kiwi color!!Others complained about a chemical smell - I never had that.A couple things I wish were a little different:1.) I wish the backrest was not so rounded at the top and I like how the Bumbo seat has ""arm rests"" in a way.2.) The BebePod is quite slippery and it looks like the Bumbo seat is not. (I've never even touched a Bumbo seat though so I don't know for sure.)3.) While the Bebepod is foam, it's a little harder than I expected. I'm curious to know if the Bumbo seat is any softer. On the other hand, I understand it can't be too soft or it wouldn't be safe enough for a baby to sit in it.But this product was great for what I was looking for! My daughter is 14 weeks old and so far seems to enjoy it. She's not quite coordinated enough yet to play with the toy, but I'm sure she'll love it.******UPDATE*********We absolutely LOVE the bebePod! Our daughter is 8 months old now and it's one of her favorite places to be! She ABSOLUTELY LOVES the toy it comes with and spends a long time contently playing with it! She gets so excited when she sees it coming!VERY HAPPY with our decision to purchase this over the Bumbo seat. We love how the tray slides in instead of just sits on top like the bumbo tray. So far, the toy has yet to be pulled out of the tray by our daughter, which is something I was worried about.I put her in it while I shower and get ready for the day, giving me all the time in the world!!BUY IT! You'll LOVE it!",True
"Length:: 0:36 MinsOur newborn used to hate tummy time until my sister got us this as a gift! Now he loves loves tummy time. This is him doing TT at 3 weeks. The best part is that this can be used for multiple things, like making the stroller cozy for walks. It is very soft and cozy. I wish I had one in my size!My sister also got us the lambskin wash too. The directions for maintaining the lambskin doesn't require it but it seems like a good idea to use. You should wash it once a month.",True
"I bought this for my 14 month old who likes to swing a leg over the crib rail like she's trying to get out. I hope this keeps her from being able to climb out for a while. Also, it gives her extra warmth without having to worry about keeping a blanket on top of her.",True
"Good price for a cute cover for your boppy. Not quite as soft as the plush covers, but totally reasonable softness--like a crib sheet. This design is not mommy-chic but it is baby-cute.",True
"This is similar to Avent wide neck bottle but I got this because this claim to be Bisphenal A free. Although BPA is not a officially banned, why take a chance. It's a little more expensive than other bottles; about $10 each. The only con is that there is an air venting piece which means more to clean but much easier compared to the Dr. Brown tubes. I'm glad that I could boil the bottles knowing that no chemicals are leaked out.",True
"I have an electric stove and for the big knobs it worked perfect so no one can just push it in and turn them on, but for the smaller knobs on the stove I was not able to use these. I would love for them to make these for smaller knobs as well, but for now i can just pull the smaller knobs off so little hands can't turn them.",True
"About a year ago, we looked at front swivel wheel jogging strollers. We wanted one with a supportive seat that would allow our son to sit more upright than most jogging strollers allowed. We also wanted one with a child tray. We opted to get the Instep Safari TT Single Stroller (which I think is the same as the Schwinn Safari TT Swivel Stroller) over one of the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Strollers. We were able to buy the Instep much cheaper than the Jeep. Also, the Jeep we saw had speakers for a cd player which we had no interest in using. We have just recently purchased a used 2003 Jeep stroller. For our current off-road, non-jogging purposes, this is working out better.I would like to offer our comparison of the Instep/Schwinn Safari and the Jeep. There seems to be a few choices in Jeep models. Ours is used and I don't know which we have. Therefore, these are just basic guidelines.We've taken both strollers around a neighborhood with sporadic sidewalks and no curb cutouts and both have handled the mixed/rough terrain well. We've also walked on the university campus where there are small (2') hills and both strollers go up and down them fine.My main complaints with the Instep, and what I like about the Jeep, are little things. The cupholders are so shallow that bottles of water fall over. The child tray is not removable. When our son falls asleep we have to lift him out over the tray. The sunshade is beyond stupid. We live in Arizona and the Instep shade provides no protection from the sun. It actually curves upwards. We bought a Kiddopotamus sunshade. Although it provides ample sun protection, our son must essentially look out a tube. I don't know if the Jeep sunshade will be better, we haven't used it for daytime walks yet. However, it seems bigger and does not curve up and let the sun in. I will address the bad Instep brakes later.The Instep is bigger and the seat for the child is roomier. However, there is more head clearance space under the Jeep Canopy. I wonder if the foot rest on the Jeep will be outgrown faster than the footrest on the Instep.The seat on the Jeep seems better padded. The one we bought was FILTHY when we got it and it cleaned up easily. I had been certain it would be covered in stains, but it looks brand new. The Instep has a thin seat cover that can be removed for washing. However, it is velcroed in place. When our son sits down, we have to hold the pad in place or it slips and wads up underneath him.There are reflectors attached all over the Jeep. The Instep has no reflectors that I've ever noticed.The handle on the Instep is adjustable, so you can make it taller. You can also position it facing backwards and be further back from the stroller. This is probably advantageous for joggers. The Jeep is okay height for me 5'7"" and I think my 6' husband is okay, but much taller and the Jeep handle might be too short.The back wheels on our Instep are bigger than the rear wheels on the Jeep. That might make a difference for someone who jogs. I haven't jogged with either stroller.Our Instep has a locking front wheel as does our Jeep. I don't know if all models of each brand lock or not.The brake system on the Jeep is better. Although they both have foot brakes that interact with the rear wheels, the Instep partially falls into place when you go over bumps. You then get a bump-bump-bump rhythm in the stroller. My husband actually stretched a bungie cord between the handle bar and the foot bar to prevent this. I haven't noticed the Jeep brake falling into place.I like the cargo basket better on the Jeep because it is bigger and much more accessible. Another advantage of the Jeep is for our son. He loves to push the stroller like he does shopping carts. He grabs the horizontal bar at the back of the stroller and pushes. On the Instep, this is the brake so he sets the brake. On the Jeep, he grabs and pushes with the cargo basket so he does not set the brake. The cargo basket on the Instep is very inconvenient. It's small and it is hard to get stuff in and out. I suspect for someone jogging, they would collide with the Jeep basket but not with the Instep basket.We've never used the Instep as a jogger, but rather as an off-road stroller. Now that I have used both, I think the Jeep is better for off-road general stroller, but the Instep is probably better for jogging. I still like the cup holders, sunshade, brakes, and removable tray of the Jeep MUCH better and think the Instep would be a superior stroller if it had those. Although I like the jeep cargo basket for my purpose, I think the Instep cargo basket that doesn't stick back, the handle that folds backwards, and the large rear wheels could possibly make a difference for a jogger.As of this writing, amazon does not offer the front swivel Jeep. However, it can be ordered from other sites. Some models are as cheap as $100 at some retailers.",True
"Great iteam,no odor ,I keep it in the babys room no bad smell you could use regular trash bags no necessary needs to buy special ones.A friend gave it to us cause his baby dont need it and still work as new...I was thinking to buy it at first when i saw it at the store...",True
I decorated my entire nursery with this theme and am so pleased I could not have found a better set than this one...I highly recommend this set to everyone...,True
"We've used this monitor for 4 months now.Likes:- very sensitive. Went off only once with baby in bed (because the sensor pad had been moved to one side of the crib after changing the sheets and the baby was on the other side of the crib)- can turn off movement sensor to just use sound monitor- gives me some extra ease of mind even though my baby is low risk of SIDS- has two receiving units- long enough range that I can take the receiving unit outside- receiving unit lights up when baby cries (nice for use while taking a shower)Dislikes:- only has 2 channels. Receiving units pick up static almost all the time from lights, computers, cell phone, you name it. However, we have not picked up our nextdoor neighbor's baby monitor.- hard to turn off receiving unit without loud static noise (not good for middle of the night feedings when you want your spouse to stay asleep)- need board over springs on crib for movement sensor pad- very senstive - the baby's ceiling fan on high moves the mobile, which is attached to the crib, enough that the sensor picks up movement even with the baby not in the crib. Also, adults walking around the nursery causes the sensor pad to pick up movement.- alarm goes off when you pick up the baby and forget to switch off the movement sensor",True
"The bag was a little stiff at first. The Graco car seat fits in great. It was easy to put in and remove from bag, it comes with a strap if you need to tote it around.",True
This is a cute curtain although it is an orange/pink rather than the pink it shows in the picture. My problem with it was that in the description it is supposed to be 84 inches long and it is only 55 inches long. Now I have to order a second one so that it will be long enough to cover my window. It does look nice in the window though.,True
"This is a great gate! Super easy to install! Unlike other reviewers, ours makes little to no noise when it closes. And our 10 month old son has been able to walk out of it without tripping over the bar across the bottom. The gate is very study and has a better ""look"" than many of the other baby gates. We are definitely pleased!",True
"This bag fits our Keyfit carseat and our Chicco umbrella stroller, which is nice because you don't have to pay for it when you check it! Wish the bag was padded but it is good otherwise.",True
"Our baby LOVES this bed! The attachable toy hanger is great for suspending little toys above her so she can bat and play with them. The bed is very sturdy and easy to open and close and comes with a duffel style bag for transporting. Very light weight, easy to move around. Colors go very well together. Great product!",True
"My 2 month old baby absolutely adores this mobile. Whenever we put her under it (it's attached to her crib, but she still sleeps in a cradle), she stares up at it with great interest. Even better, it often elicits smiles and laughs!Many reviewers are disappointed that the mobile doesn't move, but, personally, I don't think that's a problem. Sometimes I move the mobile for her, but it doesn't seem necessary. She's perfectly content when it's stationary.Here are some of the downsides:1) It didn't come with all of the pictures shown :/ We got two sets of the same pictures. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or if this is what everyone gets.2) Switching out the pictures is not easy--the holes are small and the cards are not flexible.3) The mounting arm, a huge chunk of plastic, is rather unattractive. It was, initially, kinda painful to install this in my daughter's otherwise adorable (and nearly plastic free) nursery. But. . . she does love it, so I'm over it.It's not a perfect mobile, but I'd still highly recommend it.",True
"I like that the towel is big, soft and absorbent. The only thing I don't like is that the monkey applique is rough and we can't really dry our son's hair with that portion since it's too rough.",True
"Why even wait to see if your baby is gassy...try these bottles. Most people complain about all of the parts, but there really aren't many and it's worth the few extra seconds per bottle to clean the additional pieces.",True
"This cover is great and we use it every day with our daughter. It really is quite warm - when our daughter is in the Bjorn her front side stays toasty, and this cover really keeps the heat in so we don't have to overdress her. In cold weather we just put on her jacket and a hat, and then this cover makes everything toasty. I only wish we could use it longer, as she's getting too tall!",True
"i loved this item, i purchased the sling which i also like, but was given this item, and used it a lot too. it keeps your arms free while the baby is very secure even when cant hold head up yet. and you can finally get some things done in the house. great back support, and baby loves to bounce around seeing all the action while being close to mommy. dont buy the more expensive designer ones, waste of money.",True
"Huggies are my number one diaper,they amaze me. They are super absorbent and my grandson has NEVER had diaper rash. That to me is amazing.",True
"I LOVE this product! We have used it in our king size bed and it is great!! No concerns as the baby is totally safe and she can smell me which helps her not only fall asleep better, but also stay asleep. We had tried putting in her carrier to sleep(which I hated doing) because the playard she was sleeping in was just too hard, I think, so once we got her to sleep she would wake up when we set her down. Now she either sleeps between us in our bed or in the Safe and Secure Sleeper inside her playard. Since it has a little mattress it's more comfy. Plus we use it to get her to sleep downstairs, then just move her (in the sleeper) up to her playard without her waking up. I only wish I had found this product earlier as my daughter is now 2 months old.",True
"I bought these so I could freeze breast milk. I wasn't sure if the ice trays that came with the fridge were bpa free so wanted to get something that was. Having the lid is a bonus. The only downside to this product is that even when filled to the brim each cube is only about 2/3 an oz but once you know that it's easy to plan accordingly. For just freezing breast milk, you don't really need a 2pk, but if I decide to make my own baby food I think the second one will come in handy.",True
"I bought this monitor at the advice of a friend. I am so happy that I did. Originally we were going to get one of those camera monitors, but I am so happy we changed our mind. I love the sensor board that goes underneath the crib mattress. It gives me such piece of mind. I don't have to go in there and check to be sure she is breathing every 10 minutes. I know that if she should stop, the monitor would sound an alarm. I know that it works because I have already removed her from the crib and forgot to shut off the sensor section of the monitor and the alarm is loud. I try everything I can to prevent SIDS. I believe that this monitor is just one more precaution I can take. I would strongly suggest this to anyone.",True
"I really loved the quality, haven't washed yet so I don't know. Ordered blue they sent me off white didn't have time to exchange since it was a gift",True
"We bought this jumper and Olivia really liked it but only for short periods of time. For something free-standing there is not enough toys to keep her entertained. She doesn't even bounce in it that much anymore at 7 months. We then purchased an older model that attaches to the door frame and she went nuts in that. I don't know why but she stays in that MUCH longer and seems to have alot more fun. So if you can find a nice one, I'd get the ""johnny jump-up"" model before spending on this. We found a new one for $10.00 at a second hand store.",True
"The play mat actually works great for our room. I like the colors, the thickness, the smell wasn't really strong, but had a ""new"" smell for a couple days.To help save on cost we bought them used through Amazon. And they actually appeared in almost new condition... Unfortunately I wanted two packages to combine them together to make a larger play area. It appeared from the picture that would be easy to do. However, when received we got two different versions of this product. One was exactly as we planned. But the other had finished corners so we couldn't attach them and they also had bigger connectors then the other one. Plus the colors were off and didn't look right.We are returning the one that didn't match, hopefully we'll get what we intended in the end.",True
"My baby and I both love these bottles. I started her on the playtex nurser but got tired of buying the drop ins and the wide nipple made her dribble milk out of her mouth.Since using these bottles she has not spit up once and she is less gassy. I have read that some of the reviewers claim the nipples dont work... there is a trick. The nipples are designed to be sucked at the tip not the base so when she is sucking on the nipple, I gently pull it out of her mouth and she gobbles it down.They are not difficult to clean. I just take them apart and throw them in a dishwasher basket and reassemble.",True
"We purchased this carseat cover for our third child, and I wish so much we would have had one of these with our two older children! This cover is the BEST--I cannot think of anything I would want to change about it. There are slits in the back that accomodate carseat and stroller straps; and the slits velcro close to keep cold air out if you are using the cover as a simple bunting. The fabric is really soft, and it has a removable hood to cover baby's face when bringing him out in the cold Minnesota weather. And you can also use your carseat's sun-visor with this model, unlike some the others I've used. This Wrap-n-Ride is also a lot less expensive than some other covers I've seen, which makes it a great value too. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a baby in cold weather.",True
I got this for my daughter and we've had it about 7 months. She's 11 months now and finally can use it without putting a pillow behind her. But it's very nice and we'll be able to use it for our next baby.,True
"I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him. This tub is great, I even use it at home. I started using this tub when my son was 6 months, he is now 9 months old. Now that he sits up on his own, it's a lot easier to bathe him. I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly, all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat. If you travel, it's a great idea to get an inflatable tub, it's portable, and quite sturdy.",True
"My son is fascinated with this mobile. He smiles and coos as he stares up at the pictures. I love that you can change out the pictures to keep it fresh and new for the baby. My only complaint is that the cards are a little hard to change out, and some of the cards can't be moved down so the baby can see them. I wish all the cards had the middle slot to put them in the baby's eye line. Overall, though, this is a great mobile and I would reccomend it to anyone.",True
"I don't mind the odd shape of this shawl so much, and the thumb loops top and bottom are kind of handy. However, the thumb loops are absolutely necessary, because my daughter could easily pull it off otherwise (because it was so short). It also gets VERY dark in there unless I continually hold the top loop away from my body, which makes my arm tired pretty quickly.I went back to using a light-colored large baby blanket - it provides better coverage, and my daughter doesn't try to throw it off, because she can still see.",False
"One day recently, at 11pm, long after we put out 10 month-old to bed in his crib, we hear ""The sun is shining..."" coming from his playroom. Then 11pm, 12am, 1am... you get the idea. We have had the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker for since Christmas. His interest is minimal for this toy. I would like to say it's educational but I'm in reality on the fence about that statement. It hardly keeps his attention, and the voice is hard to understand - so how can he really learn? All he cares to do is eat the phone and pull the shapes of the mounts. I thought it was a good toy from the description and design so I requested it as a Christmas present. I can say now after 3-months of use, I don't like it much and wish I had asked for something else.",False
"After trying for a half hour to figure out how to lock the tabs in place, we thought we had it figured out - the tub then literally gushed water all over the table. We tried to give it a chance 2 more times and it still leaked. Tried it inside the bathtub and all the water leaked out - poor baby. Do not buy this, it will only make you mad and be most unpleasant for your baby.",False
"I requested this sheet on my registry. When I received it I was quite disappointed at how flimsy the sheet was. I also didn't care for how easily it comes off of the pad. I ended up putting a blanket down for my baby to lay on because I didn't trust that the sheet would stay put. Also, given how thin it is, it would take only a few minutes for a pool of drool to end up on the pad itself. I was very disappointed.",False
"We bought this product for a 2000-mile road trip with our 14-month old. We found it was too thick to be helpful in keeping her head propped up in a good position as she slept to prevent wheezing. If we put it around the back or sides of her neck, her head would fall forward and her breathing wouldn't be smooth. If we put it around the front of her neck, it wouldn't stay put or she would pull it off. On the positive side, it worked reasonably well for me and my 16.5-inch neck, but we will be looking into something more wedge-shaped that goes around the front of the neck for the next trip with our toddler.",False
"I think this could be a good monitor except for the 2 way communication feature. Just as with many monitors you can pick up interferance on the parents end,but since the childs end is also a reciever it picks up interferace as well. We have been trying to use it for a week and the monitor in our sons room picks up phone conversations in the middle of the night which of course wakes him up. Not a good idea!",False
"I am ready to buy new monitors. Not only have the receivers always had static and feedback but after less than a year use, the one contact for the receiver is bad. Depending on the position of the cord, the receiver disconnects and therefore, is not very helpful in monitoring my son. I really dislike the amount of 'white noise' both receivers produce. We have experimented with moving it to different outlets and different positions in our house and it is NEVER quiet.",False
"My kids are 32 months apart and this stroller did not work well for us. My 2 year old hated sitting in the back seat. The front seat poked her in the back when the car seat was in it, she hated riding backwards and she had no where to nap if she was tired...running errands was awful!! The carseat converter was hard to take on and off (I pinched my fingers all the time). The front seat hardly reclines and is not soft at all...which means no napping in this stroller!

Out of all the baby products I have received this tub HAS TO BE THE WORST! The major problem with it is it leaks all over the place. The directions are so hard to understand in the first place and it was more trouble than it was worth to put together! I have used it a couple of times and am ready to throw it out the window! I will be investing in another tub - hopefully one that does not leak!!!!!,False
"My husband often dreams of how he will dispose of this monitor. One of his biggest complaints with this monitor is that the lowest volume setting is very quiet and the next volume level up is very loud. From there, it just gets even louder. Most every sound is distorted and a bit frightening. Our first one broke and we had to have it replaced... he thinks we should have just bought a different model a long time ago. That said, this monitor has really helped to teach him patience, so it can't be all that bad! ;-)",False

"I really wanted to like this carseat but after 4 months of using it, I can't recommend it at all. With my older daughter, we used the Graco Snugride which was great over time - lightweight, clips into everything, good shade, roomy - but she hated it for the first couple of months and we thought it wasn't comfortable enough. So this time around, we looked for a carseat that looked comfy. This one certainly seemed to fit the bill - the fabrics are high quality, there is a lot of padding, and it includes the Mother's Lap insert which seemed great. I do think that the carseat is well padded and comfortable in that sense. Unfortunately, all of the padding and especially the temperpedic-style foam padding makes my daughter extremely hot. She is dripping in sweat when we take her out of the carseat. Overheating is very unsafe for newborns.It is a constant annoyance that the carseat won't clip into shopping carts and I have to set it in the body of the shopping cart leaving no room for items. The sunshade is way too small and doesn't cover her at all and also comes detached all the time. Whenever you try to rotate the carseat handle, the sunshade is in the way and I end up trying to cram it under the handle and then it comes detached.All in all, I have been extremely disappointed by this seat and if she weren't already almost out of it, I would have switched back to Graco.",False
"This is the worst. We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months. Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor. It isn't even in the same league.

Just wish we never registered for this product.",False

I will return it for a different one as soon as possible!!",False
"I really like the functionality of this high chair. It came with all the pieces and was easy to put together--it is sturdy. It is also pretty scratched up and had some decent gauges in the wood. The finish of the seat was rough and low quality. We would have returned it, but we needed it ASAP and were in a jam.",False
"I was going on a trip with my 3 month old across the county and bought this for the plane ride. As far as heating bottles, this does not work at all. You have to boil the bag after each use and let it cool down completely before trying to use it again which is a real hassle. It also activates when you don't want it to. Most importantly, it doesn't heat the bottle at all. It's a neat product, and I would recomend this for using as cordless heating pad for your sore muscles...but not for heating bottles.",False
"This wireless video system arrived and seemed perfect...until I turned it on. Our house is full of 2.4Ghz stuff like cordless phones and a wireless network. Sad to say the receiver didn't function well at all in this environment--so many static lines and jumps that it was virtually worthless. Other than the fact that it was not designed to operate with simple wirelss items that the majority of American homes now have, it does seem to be a sweet little wireless video system. Perhaps if you live in a vacuum in the middle of no where it would be perfect to keep an eye on the local wildlife... :O)",False

If your child gets a fierce diaper rash using these, consider the possibilty of an allergy..or better yet, don't use nut products like shea butter (which comes from the shea NUT) on babies when you don't know if they will be allergic...exposing them repeatedly so early on to nuts may trigger a nut allergy due to ""system overload.""",False
"Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, ""unacceptable"" because it's unsafe. (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.) Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay. Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should. CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling. Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store. Be sure to avoid model 14565!",False
"Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed.",False
"My son is 2 1/2 and this potty has been a nightmare for us. First, it did have a tendency to go off at all times of the day and night, and 2nd, the splash guard is not tall enough or secure enough. I can't even begin to count the times that I've turned around and seen him chewing on the guard he's removed or how often urine has shot across the bathroom because his penis is pointing 1 cm off of 'straight ahead'. On the bright side, it's comfortable for him to sit on and mine has never leaked, but that just may be because the urine never quite makes it in the receptacle.",False
"I own one of these things and have used it once. To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain. Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks. It is also not very lightweight. I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down. I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road. And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water. Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing. I wouldn't buy it again.",False

"My daughter had an allergic reaction to this product--a rash on her lower back the morning after she wore the Goodnite the first night. We tried again the next night, and the rash became worse (she stayed dry all night both nights). We tried using the Goodnites a few nights after that, putting a pair of underwear on her first and then putting it over to protect her, but the Goodnite caused a rash anywhere it touched her lower back where the underwear wasn't protecting her. Just want to add that my daughter has never actually had an allergy to anything before that I know of, and we've used a lot of different brands of diapers.Also, don't be fooled that this will look like underwear in any way, this looks like a soft fluffy pull-up. When we took them out of the wrapper, my 2 year-old said ""that's a diaper! that's a pull-up"" and my 4 year-old was only willing to wear it because there is a picture of an older girl on the package.",False
"I tried this product based on the convincing positive reviews. I am very disappointed. This thing is so hard to operate one-handed. I don't like to leave the baby on the changing table for even a second, and with this device you have to have both hands to push diaper in, and then twist. I just set the diaper half way in now &amp; hope that I remember to push it through, and twist it when I have a spare minute, but it's a pain. I know a bunch of other mothers who also have used the genie, and were not impressed. I wish I would have taken their advice in the first place.",False
"I love this brand of bottles but, buy the thinner bottles. The wide Dr Brown bottles cost more and were to big for my daughter. The other nipples were better on the thinner, tall Dr. Brown bottles. Easier for a newborn to eat from the thinner bottles",False
This item looks great but is cheaply made and isnt even safe for your baby. The red wipes case transfers red color to all your wipes and when you report the issue to the company they do not care. They delete your posts on their facebook wall if it doesnt favor them. Do not buy this product or any skip hop product for that matter. Your baby deserves to use products made by a company that will stand behind their product and that actually cares about the welfare of your baby.,False

"This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out, and NO shower pull-up handle (look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations.) On top of that, this cover is too short for any of our spigots!One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover, the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front.This cover won't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle. If your spigot has a flat-top shower pull-up or it can be unscrewed, then perhaps you can make this work.AND it's too short! When the cover is on a spigot, the back of the cover won't meet the tile wall, which means it can't be caulked into place, which means it is easily bumped out of position, spewing water everywhere, or perhaps worse, falling off the spigot entirely. No good!This product should have been designed to accommodate more styles of spigots.",False

"I'm the type of consumer who rarely writes a bad review, but these diapers deserve it, especially for being Pampers brand and not just a generic. The mesh inside the diaper sticks to one side and completely rips apart when you try to separate the mesh from the side of the diaper so that you can place your baby in it. Pampers is still a great brand, and we've never had a problem with them before, but steer clear of this particular product. Poorly designed and LOW quality.",False

"About two weeks after sending the last of my easy to use First Years baby gates to the Goodwill, we decided to get a puppy. I looked around for those same baby gates, but couldn't find any. I found this gate and, while it is absolutely hideous, it's was cheap, which is good since I didn't know how long I'd need it for.I realize some people here have found this gate easy to use, but I am not one of them. I can't imagine how people are able to operate it one handed. Sure, it's easy to unlatch and remove from the door frame one handed, but setting it back up is a challenge. Maybe it was just my particular gate, but it didn't slide easily AT ALL. It took quite a bit of effort to pull the one side out to make it larger, then I would have to carefully tap it down to the size I needed so it would fit the door frame again, since the four rubber stoppers prevented me from just slipping it back into the doorway. At first I thought it was just me, but even husband, a naval nuclear engineer, struggled with it...so that made me feel better. Again...it may just be our particular gate, but my experience with it has been mostly negative.In the end I'm glad I went cheap because we ended up not really needing it (puppy is kept in the bathroom at night with the door closed instead of a gate up), but we'll keep it around just in case. If you're planning on using this for a child, I say pass...unless you're going to put it up in a doorway and leave it there. In that case it's a great gate because it's so cheap. But it your planning on removing it frequently from wherever you put it, look elsewhere.",False
"Let me emphasize how HORRIBLE THE RECEPTION ON THIS THING IS!! We bought it a week ago and have been playing with it to get it to work without sounding like an static-filled air control tower. Moving it from place to place, etc. My husband and I have not rested well since we bought the damn thing. Last night we even got in an argument, half-asleep in the middle of the night because that stupid thing just flared up and got all loud and static around 2 a.m. Even if we turn on the PS2, the TV or god forbid talk on the phone or walk by it...forget it. Now, here we go again back to the store........don't waste your money!!",False
This chair is such a pain to move anywhere. I would like this chair fine if I didn't want to move it around my kitchen. The brakes are constantly being pushed down by the covers of the legs and I can't get it to roll. I don't personally use the brakes yet because my daughter doesn't move it. I have been trying to contact Graco to see if this is a common problem and what they will do to fix it.,False
"I set this gate up at the bottom of the stairs in my house, but from the start, it didn't feel very sturdy. The metal parts are nice, but the locking mechanism is mostly plastic, and made very poorly. I have needed to tighten the gate at least once each day during the four days it has been installed. If it is a little loose, it pops open with a little shaking, which my 18 month old has already done. We are shopping for a new gate.",False
I didn't think these bottles were that great. My child isn't collicky and doesn't have digestive problems so maybe I would rate this item differently if she were. I thought maybe she would burp or spit up less with these bottles compared to regular bottles but she didn't. Plus there are more parts to clean. My husband hated them after the first couple of tries but I wanted to give them a chance. So after a couple of weeks I also gave up on them and use them as regular bottles instead of attaching all the parts. Save your money and get a different brand.,False
"I purchased this stroller for 2 based on manuvarability and stability.. I could not have picked a worse choice!! Within 30 days, the fabric was ripping, it is lighter than most strollers for 2, yet this is not as convienient as it seemed. The wheels have to lock in certain positions, the basket is lightweight and very unaccessable and it does not have a kick bar (the bar in the back of the stroller to help position to go up curbs, the one that you lean your weight on). When the front is reclined, the child in the fronts feet and legs are being squished. The sun shades / hoods are not easily moved to position for shade.Amazon has agreed to take stroller back.. I'm extremely happy about that!!!I would not recommend this product at all..MOM of TWINS..",False

We were up in Conn. during a snowstorm over Halloween weekend recently, and being from VA, i wanted to make sure she stayed warm, so i got some tight and this to supplement what clothes i had with me to keep her warm. It did keep her warm, but it doesn't even go to the end of the car seat on either end, and my husband hates to try and buckle her in with it as he has a hard time find where straps have gone, its a good thing i don't think we will be using it long as shes over 6 months now. I posted pictures because i wanted to see how they fit before buying one initially, and nowhere did i find pictures of them on different brand seats.",False
"My husband wanted this and I totally poo-pooed it at first. But the itz-been is so simple and exactly what new parents need! when you're not sleeping and can barely remember when you last showered, and it seems like you are feeding or changing the baby every other minute this is great at helping you keep track of things. It's especially great before you discern your baby's cries - I learned that if it wasn't 2 hours since she was fed, chances were the baby wasn't hungry.",1
I was skeptical about getting this tub especially after reading the reviews that said that tub leaks. I found one good review and I got the tub anyway. The first things the instruction booklet said is that the tub must be open to the fullest to prevent leaks. I have not had a problem with the tub since.,1

I'm actually going to return it for a full size swing.",1

And i'm glad that when the baby is bigger, I can go on long walks with both of them with ease. There is no comparison between the jogging stroller, and my regular stroller. It pushes easily, even over rough sidewalks or grass, and has a pretty good sized basket for a jogger. If you need a double jogger, you can't go wrong with this one!",1
Decent item for light duty use. Has a little lever action to ensure a tight fit.,1
The thing about this strap is that it uses the latch system on the car seat. So you have to adjust for the suitcase. Then adjust for the car. Then adjust for the suitcase again. I am travelling alone with my son. There is no way one person can work this. So unless your going to be traveling with someone I do not recommend it at all.,0
"Ok, maybe I'm partially to blame as I did NOT look at each of the color samples. After receiving my chair almost 2 WEEKS LATE it was not cherry wood as I would typically think of it. It appears as more of a walnut stain. Not exactly what I had hoped for. In addition to this, the tray was damaged and could potentially pose a choking hazard. We all know how little fingers like to pick at things and a piece of the splintering wood could have chipped off and been swallowed. Or been a splinter to remove from little fingers. Now, Baby Because wants me to pay the $24 to ship it back to them and $24 to ship a new one in ""Mahogany"". Not exactly the convenience I had hoped for!",0

"Let's get real here. Diapers stink. If you're looking for a product to cure that particular problem, your search should end here. Diaper Genie works.I have used both types of diaper pails, and Diaper Genie is the hands down winner. Sure it comes with a hefty instruction sheet, which I had to take out and refer to the first few times I emptied it. My husband has no idea how to empty it, (or maybe he's just playing me!) and yes, my mother in law has yet to figure it out. I also am not thrilled with the added expense of having to buy special liners. But in spite of this, I can't think of a better way to dispose of diapers.My son's room is pretty small, and you would never know there is a full pail in there. I only have to empty it every week or so, just cut the liner and pop out the sausages. (Or, &quot;stinky links&quot; as we're so fond of calling them) Buy it, use it, pass it along.

We used this cllp when we were in Disney and it was fantastic! It held so many bags on our double stroller and worked out perfectly!,1
"I heard so many great things about the Baby Bjorn and decided to try it out. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with it. Below are my pros and cons.Cons:- Huts your back after wearing it for more than 15 minutes. Weight is distributed on shoulders only. No waist strap.- Never felt like the baby was close to me, rather more like an additional appendage which got in the way of everything.- Hard to do chores with baby in the carrier.- After the first month my baby didn't like to be carried facing me. You can wear the baby facing out, but there is no support for the head.- Once baby's head didn't need the support and she could sit facing out it wasn't long before she outgrew the carrier.- Baby outgrew the carrier at 4 months (15 lbs & 26"").I also purchased the wind cover and had a hard time attaching it to the carrier. The carrier cover is to thick to attach to the carrier and still be able to buckle it. Had to hold it in order for it to stay on.Pros:- Nice design- Very easy on/off- Washable- Sturdy",0
"I'm happy with my purchase. It looks just like the picture and the material is nice (not to soft, but durable.) And is easy to place one handed on a shopping cart (the only drawback is it cannot be used for the restaurant high chairs, you have to buy their high chair cover if you want that.)",1

"This is a pain. To use this for young children is just crazy. The strap to hold it on their lap must wrap around them and their car seat. Then, hope your child doesn't want it off until you are done with the car ride. They can't remove it themselves since the strap latch needs both hands and it is pretty much behind them! It also isn't as firm a surface and the edges are so misshapen from shipping that they don't stand upright. I wish I hadn't bought these. I'm hoping that saving them for later years will come to some use.",0
"I am truly and completely baffled. How this product has received so much praise is beyond me.I won't waste my time or yours. I'll say it bluntly and plainly: this product is a joke for the three reasons that follow.Reason # 1) This cotton cloth is several feet wide and a few long, and sells for $30 dollars. Seriously. You'll open the package and find an oddly contoured blanket that is, according to the product description on this site, and I quote, ""...made of the finest, softest, most durable cotton knit produced and designed to be washed over and over..."". Isn't that description just heavenly? Well, what you quickly realize when you open the package, however, is that it's just cotton. Nothing special. Just cotton. Selling for $30 dollars.Reason # 2) Take a close look at the lower half of the product in the picture... specifically where those adorable little legs and feet go... closer... closer... there! That's right, those little infant legs and feet are completely loose and free to kick up and down and all around. This is not good... not good at all. Legs that are kicking and thrashing keeps that adorable little angel nice and awake, providing that very special mommy/daddy bonding experience that can only occur at 3am. Mommy, daddy, buy the visine in bulk, because your bloodshot eyes, the following morning, are going to need it.Reason # 3) However tight I wrap my little angel with the heavenly stretchy cotton cloth, he manages to get lose. If he doesn't get lose, I wake the next morning to find his little arms pinned in a disturbing position that can't possibly be comfortable. I refuse, and will never, put him through that again.So there you have it, stated plain and to the point. I apologize for my unnecessary sarcasm. It's just that this miracle blanket is a miracle gimmick that is outrageously overpriced considering the material. I feel like a sucker for having thought there might be something special to this product given its name and the glowing reviews. I have since learned how to properly and easily swaddle my baby the good'ol fashion way: with an ordinary cotton blanket that cost a couple of bucks.",0
"It is supposed to reward with music but for the new at potty training every time you fidget just a little the music starts and by the time it finishes it only starts again, by the time something does happen the child is tired on the music and does not realize its a reward!!

I NEVER heard my baby's heart beat, all I do is rely on my doctors visits. I see her kicking all the time, but I never hear her kicking. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.The only good thing would be the microphone that is included so that you can talk to your baby, but you can pick that up a lot cheaper!",0
"I'm a Pampers fan! From Swaddlers to Cruisers to Baby Dry. But when my daughter moved up to size 5, the pamper leaks at night. She is a soaking mess in the morning. And the soaking is the particles in the diaper. The diaper literally falls apart. I bought one case and it's is almost finished thankfully. Back to Cruisers we go!",0
We just bought this monitor for our grand babies. We love it. It has great range and no static (as long as the monitor in the baby's room is on). You can really hear the slightest sounds. So we are very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!,1
"I got these for eating at restaurants with my twins. I loved that they had the little catch-cup to help keep food OFF my kids and they provided clean-by-my-standards surface for them to eat off of.However, I found that the suction cups do NOT stick if the table isn't either laminant or extremely laquered. If the table has any ""roughness"" at all...forget about these things sticking to it!Also while it's great that your child doesn't have to touch the nasty restaurant table...you have to either take the stains and crumbs with you or go rinse the thing in the bathroom! I have twins & I don't want to drag my babies to the bathroom in the restaurant to rinse them off before I leave. Even if you do rinse them...they're wet and drippy in your diaper bag unless you take the time to dry them. Too labor-intensive for me.It rolls up, which is great for portability. Now maybe I'm alone in this but I had what I call ""Mommy Brain"". As soon as I put the things in the diaper bag, I forgot about them. It was a week before I needed to use my diaper bag again...and discovered that I'd placed these placemats in there dirty...and they were nasty after a week to ferment.I've found it's just easier to use the stick-on disposible placemats.",0
"I purchased this for my son and we love it! It lights up his room well, and it's a perfect night light. The stars and constellations are clear, and my son loves that you can choose different colors. I love that it has an automatic shut off timer too. Very nice Night Light and a great deal on Amazon. Highly recommend this for any toddlers room.",1
"dont buy...i call this stroller the ""beast"" hard to turn. You have to take pieces apart to store it. I have a Ford expedition and it takes up the entire trunk space because it has to be placed in at an angle....i can not use my third row",0
"I just got this thing yesterday and used it today. Because of a review I read here I also got a foam insert. I ended up putting the insert halfway into the tub and leaning my son's head against the molded headrest and his behind against the insert and WOW!IT WAS SO EASY!!!!In the infant tub he was always listing sideways (he's 3.5 months old right now, technically too young for the snug-tub and he can't sit up by himself yet though he's great with support) and thanks to the contoured headrest in the snug-tub he did GREAT. He also had more water around him so he wasn't cold while I washed him like he was in his infant tub.He sat there and would not stop smiling at me! And my back didn't hurt from holding him constantly with both arms AND washing him at the same time, though I had to lean over the bathtub!I've decided to recommend this thing to EVERYONE I know who is having a baby!",1
I love these and they are very hard to find. Have contacted Johnson and Johnson but they were not helpful. The lavender ones are better but have been discontinued!!,0
"First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box. BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.",0
"This cream just doesn't stay on, which renders it useless as a barrier cream as far as I can tell. It's too creamy and wipes right off. My daughter got a very nasty diaper rash and I couldn't figure out why her rash wasn't improving despite medication. Thankfully, I ran out of Mustela and had to buy something quick at the local store. Once I switched to Desitin, improvement began immediately, and you can understand why. Desitin is 40% zinc oxide and very thick. It doesn't all rub off on the diaper the second you put it back on, unlike this stuff. As a new mom, I didn't know the difference, but now I do. I'm hopeful that this will help other new moms too.I just don't recommend this product if a rash has already developed. Perhaps as a preventative measure, it works fine.",0
"I registered for the Diaper Champ, but for some reason received not one but two Diaper Genies from well meaning friends. I had already purchased a Diaper Champ, so I guess I was spoiled with the ease. The diaper genie was just too complicated to set up and operate in the middle of the night with sleep deprivation and a brand new infant. We just put it (preassembled) into the nursery for our first attempt at sleeping in the crib and it was lousy. It just is not ""self-explanatory"" and as easy to use as the Diaper Champ. Even my parents-in-law couldn't get it to work right and just got the diaper stuck. I keep a changing table and diaper pail in our family living area and one upstairs in the for convience - let me tell you, that is great. Yes you can use the floor, but my back appreciates the table and it gives me a good place to neatly store supplies. I don't notice any odor from the diaper champ in the living area unless I'm standing directly over it or opening it to change it (and it currently holds diapers from a 6 month old starting solid food and a toddler). It gets full and changed approximately every other day. I returned both diaper genies and am happily using my very simple to operate diaper champ which uses any old bag you like. Maybe if I had studied the directions again with more patience, got everything set up in advance, and practiced during the daylight time, I'd have been happier with this contraption. Although I still would not be happy with the scented bags it uses - the only thing worse than a bad smell, is a good smell trying to cover a bad smell.",0
This nipple seemed too big for my daughter's mouth. She actually latched better without it even though I bought it in hopes that this would help her stay latched on. Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me but it seems to work for many other people so it's probably worth a try if you're having trouble with your newborn.,1
"I recieved this item as a babyshower gift. It was great for my newborn, but once she started wiggling and being more active (about 4 months) I stopped using this item immediately. This item is too upright and my baby fell off the sides. She was buckled in, however her head and torso where dangling off the sides. Obviously not making her happy! DO NOT TURN YOUR BACK!!!",0
"I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.",0
"we bought this topper to use when our daughter was 6months old. we were having her use the toilet to poop instead of her cloth diapers and the big potty was too big. i tried putting her on a small potty chair and she cried. so i bought this and it was the perfect combo. she could be up high and see us but it also gave her, and us, more security while she was up there. now that she's 16mos old, she still can't climb up alone to use it but can sit all by herself on it and it appears very comfy. it adjusts to any seat and there is no danger of it slipping off or into the toilet. once she can climb up to the seat by herself, it will be even better to have (i have vivid memories of being afraid of the ""big"" potty). i prefer when she uses this seat instead of her little potty chair because i have nothing to clean up afterwards! it's really well made - buy a step-stool to go along with it and you have a place to sit while helping your little one go!",1
"From our use, this product will work wonders for outdoor belly time. Very ease to use, and fold up after use, and the blanket is larger than you would expect from the size of it folded up. Thanks.",1
"I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail. My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort. Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough. I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn! I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us. I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing.",0
"1. Not wet enough. I've had to add water to every single package I've opened. I even store them upside down and it doesn't make a difference. They're almost dry to the point of being dried out.2. They smell terrible, despite being unscented. This is the second ""good for the earth"" wipe I've tried, and the second brand that had the same gross smell. TRU and Target brand unscented are truly scent-free. The smell of the unscented Seventh Generation stuff hurts my nose.I won't buy them again, and I'll be returning two of the three cases I purchased on Amazon.",0
"i contacted ababy before purchasing this item to find out more information about the mattress. i was concerned with the firmness of it. i was told that the mattress was firm and would not conform to my baby's shape. i was also told that it met all of these safety standards and passed numerous safety tests. i purchased it based on all of the great information but was extremely disappointed once the mattress arrived. it came folded in half in a box. no firm mattress would be able to fold in half. the mattress conformed to my baby's shape after setting him on it for only a few moments. this product is not safe. babies need a firm surface to sleep on, if not, their breathing can be compromised. after i original spoke to ababy i thought that it was strange that if their product went through all of this testing and meets safety standards then why didn't they list these credentials in the product description. they don't list them because it is not true. i should of listened to my instincts and never of purchased the mattress. i had a great deal of difficulty with the return but after several complaints they finally refunded my money. don't waste your time with this product. spend the extra money and get a quality mattress for the sake of your child.",0
"My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and she already loves this. I like all of the different textures and sounds from the mat and toys- the leaf on the bottom makes crinkly sounds, there are beads in a roller, and the mat itself has silky ribbon bows and other textures. My only complaint is that the two butterflies underneath the sound box don't spin on their own. But mostly she just likes looking at them right now, so it isn't a problem. It was easy to put together, and we've used it for a few minutes a day for a few weeks and the batteries are still going strong. I also like the music (it isn't tinny sounding like some) and the forest sounds make my daughter's eyes go big and round. I received this as a gift and in addition to her bouncer, this is her favorite item.",1
We used this when my son was 1 1/2. The seat would not stay put and he kept listing off to one side.,0
"First of all I want to say that I shop around A TON to make sure I am getting the most bang for my buck. I already had the Chicco Travel System and I love it, so I was hoping there would be a great Chicco umbrella stroller too. I looked at everything from the MacLaren to the Costco. This stroller is way better than any of the other umbrella strollers. Here are some of the reasons why I love it:It is the perfect height for both me (5'4) and my husband (6'1)It is sturdy (most umbrella strollers feel like they will bend and break easily)It has an AWESOME sun shade that actually has great coverageIt has a variety of colors. We got the orange and it's not an obnoxious orange it is a very nice deep red orange colorIt is only 11 lbsIt reclinesIt has a carrying case that is easy to transportIts big enough for our son that we can use it for years to come (max limit 37 lbs) but works great now (he is almost 8 months)I would highly recommend this stroller for anyone seeking a durable, modern, affordable umbrella stroller.",1
"I bought the pillow with some skepticism as this pillow is not sold in many maternity stores in SingaporeHowever after checking out the reviews on Amazon.com, I decided to try it.It was amazing that I can sleep in my 33rd week without much ado. The unique C shape propped up my neck and I could lie on both sides without problem. I would recommend getting this pillow in your 30th week so you could spend sleeping hours productively and wake up fresh for the day.",1
"I absolutely love all of Fischer Price Ocean Wonders products! Especially this swing! My son seemed to feel secure and comfortable at 3 days old, and now at 4 months, he is entertained and soothed by the mobile, motion and sound. I love that this swing is a cradle as well. The seat cushion is very comfortable, durable and easy to clean. My only complaint is that the tray has to be opened using two hands, and is very noisy when it snaps into place. When my son falls asleep in this swing and I want to move him to his bed, I find that unsnapping the tray to get him out startles him. Otherwise, this product is absolutely great, and I highly recommend it!",1
"Product was useless, came so small it neither sat on not stayed in ace while changing a baby's diaper. Not to mention a baby who is constantlyMoving, they should at a minimum be made in selected sizes so that one of the 5 fit.I would not recommend these to anyone, they did not even look like the picture,",0
"When I first got my Diaper Champ, I had problems similiar to other reviewers - the blue ring got stuck every time I flipped the lid over. I had to tuck the blue ring back into to it's slot to keep it from getting hung up as the mechanism swiveled around. It was very frustrating. I called the company I told them about my problem. I had no receipt because I got it for a shower present. They sent me a new replacement for the entire top of the Diaper Champ at no cost. Now it works perfectly. I gave the product four stars for the hassle of having a defective product initially. However, I was very pleased with the no questions asked customer service. I love that I can use shopping bags and don't have to buy special bags for it.Update on 11/27/2010I'm still using the same Diaper Champ and my son is now 2 1/2 years old. We also have a girl that is a little over one. Between the two of them, they produce some toxic diapers. We had a problem for a while with really bad odors coming from the pail. I was almost ready to retire the Diaper Champ. However, I started usingMunchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Packin the pail and the problem is completely solved. I tried straight up baking soda in the pail, but that didn't work. Not sure what is so magical about the Arm and Hammer discs. I use them in the kitchen garbage, too and it takes care of any funky odors there as well. I still highly recommend the Diaper Champ. What a great way to reuse all those Target bags.",0
"These bottles are wonderful. We have never had any problems with feeding, she drinks just fine. The newborn nipples were too slow for her, so we just got the next stage a little earlier. They are easy to clean.Only complaint I have is that traditional bottle warmers don't work well with these because the bottoms are removeable. It took so long to heat up one bottle that we just started making a new bottle almost every time, or sticking the bottle in a bowl of hot water.",1
"We bought this monitor because we liked the idea of visually monitoring our baby. Our daughter is not even 2 years old now and we are on our 3rd monitor. The first one broke a few months after we bought it (the audio monitor broke), so we returned it to the store for a replacement. Now that one has broken a little over a year later. This time the video monitor just stopped working. We called the company & they told us that the part we needed was on back order but they would send us a brand new set, still in the box, at no charge to us. We waited 3 three weeks for our replacement to arrive. Finally I called the company back and they said it had not shipped yet!!!!! They were having ""warehouse issues"". I was told they would ship one right out to us & in 24 hours they would call me back with a tracking # for Fed Ex. Received no call. Called them again. I finally got a tracking # & called Fed Ex. Isn't it funny that it shipped the very next day after I had called. Seems like their ""warehouse issues"" are just ""customer service"" issues. Not pleased at all. Save your money & buy a different brand.",0
"I bought this tub before reading reviews,and i regret it. the tub is actually 2 pieces that snap together, it is not easy to snap together. my baby is 6 months old. i tried to set him up in the little sitting tray, his little pee pee kept smushing up against the bar. not only that, but i wanted a tub that i can lay baby down in or recline. it is not easy to rinse a baby's hair when he is sitting straight up. but the way the sitting bar is positioned, if you try to rinse his hair, you cannot do it without getting water all over the place, because his back is against the edge of the bath tub. but the thing i really dont like is that since the tub is in 2 pieces that snap together, there is a big hard plastic thing in the middle. you cannot lay baby down (without the sling, which is just for little babies) i even tried to put those little foam things in there but there is still this big lump where baby's back would be. i will be returning this, i'm sure wal-mart will not be happy with me",0
"As most of the reviews here say, mine too had lots of statics and was noisy. For a little more money I bought a ""first years"" one and it was a world of difference.",0
"We use this as a night light in the baby's room. I use the green color option for when I breastfeed at night because it allows just enough light to see by but not enough to disturb or fully wake up the baby. I then change it to amber for when she goes back down to sleep after feeding because it is a softer, dimmer light. I like that it turns off automatically. It allows enough time to breastfeed and put her down before it goes out.As for finding constellations, not such a great product because you would have to have the turtle in the middle of the room a couple of feet from the ceiling. I don't know who has a room setup to allow for that, but we don't...just buy it for a different kind of night light.",1
"I bought two of these covers for my simmons contoured changing pad. They are not very soft and look like a cheap towel. Aside from the shrinking, both my green and blue cover have faded...even with dreft only washings! After five months of use I am now trying to find a better cover that will be softer, look better & hold up to washings!",0
"I highly recommend this product. I tried several other models and brands of color video baby monitors before this system and none were as reliable. I tried several others before this one because I was reluctant to purchase a 900mhz system when 2.4mhz were available however this model provides more consistent sound and video than the 2.4mhz models of other brands of video monitor systems that I tried. The color display works best in rooms that are well lit but overall the system provides very clear display in light and dark rooms. The rechargable built in battery lasts a long time and gives a warning that the battery is dying when the monitor starts to fade. Usually the monitor doesn't have any extra background noise and only occasionally has a blast of static. The microphone works well to pick up baby's breathing. I've had the product for several weeks now and have never had to enter the baby's room due to problems with the system. It is really easy to use in the middle of the night due to the large ""snooze"" type button on top which turns on the video. This is a great product.",1
I did a lot of research and this is best quality dresser available at this price. We purchased one in white 4 yrs ago and it still looks great (see photo). I purchased a second one in espresso this week for our second child's room (see photo). It isn't complicated to assemble but it does take time and patience. It took about 1 - 1 1/2 hrs to put together. The instructions are clear but keep in mind there are similar size pieces that are finished and unfinished in the illustrations and the finished stained pieces are in the front visible and the unstained panels are in the back. Initially the drawers seemed to get stuck when I added them but I just removed and repositioned them and they all open and close smoothly. Great dresser at this price point. Highly recommend.,1
"I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.",0
"After reading everyone's great reviews, I decided to register for this pump. I am sad to say that I could not get a drip out. The suction is very poor and I would have to imagine that it would take a good hour to get any amount of breastmilk to come out if it did work! I am very disappointed in a wasted gift. The only pump that does work is the Medela Pump In Style electric pump, which unfortunately is over $300.00.I would not recommend this pump.",0
Maybe the best $ deal I found so far. I would not be with out one of these. This one is very clear and loud. I would buy another any day.,1
"I purchased this mill with carrying case as a gift. It arrived late and the box was in poor condition because Baby Haven shippers stuffed it in a large manilla envelope to mail it. I requested to return it because it was not gift worthy, Baby Haven agreed and sent me a Return number on Jan 3. I mailed it back properly in a shipping box on Jan 9 with a delivery confirmation requested. It was delivered to Baby Haven on Jan. 11. I never received an acknowledgment or credit for my return. I will not purchase anything from Baby Haven again.",0
There is no record of a recall on this product on either the consumer products safety commission website or the manufacturer's website.,0
My baby had this since she was 6 months old and she is now 13-months-old. Until recently she liked to chew on everything she could get her hands on except this toy. She would always get bored of it within a minute or two.,0
"This product made warming bottles so much easier and faster! No more sitting in hot water or boiling on the stove. Drop the bottle in, 3-4 minutes later it's ready.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because if you leave the bottle in longer, the milk continues to heat even though the heating element is off. Anything over 5 minutes for a 4oz bottle and the milk is almost boiling. So don't drop it in and walk away!",1
"This Floppy Seat was a terrible waste of $$$$. It is very cumbersome to get on to the shopping cart & the very 1st time I washed it, it came apart. It is obviously made very cheaply & not worth the money.Take my advice & don't waste your time or $$$$!",0
"This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up. Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.",1
"I got these when I was pregnant with my son. I've given him this bottle a few times and every time the milk just dribbles down his chin. He definitely gets more on him than in him. Furthermore, the two-part nipple is difficult to clean, and the wide necked bottle doesn't fit my breast pump, so I have to use a conventional bottle and then pour it into the breastflow one. It's a lot of hassle so my son can cover himself in milk. I paid $14 for a set of three and they don't do me much good. In contrast, someone gave me some angled bottles from playtex and my son hasn't had any problems - no nipple confusion or anything - with them.It's kind of disappointing.",0
"I had high hopes for this food mill and researched it carefully before purchasing. However, it has far under performed relative to expectations. The mill is chintzy (predominantly plastic with a small, dull stainless steel bar that passes for the blade). The space where you would put the food is tiny (about 1/4 cup), it's difficult to attach the grinding apparatus to the bowl, it tips over easily and overall is messy. I can only use it to grind very soft items for my baby. I am very disappointed.",0
"I was looking around for the best feeding dish when this bowl/spoon caught my eye. I read the reviews and purchased it. It was the best bowl/spoon I have ever sat in front of a kiddo! Too bad I didn't discover it until my fourth child! Like other good reviews, the shape is excellent for cornering food, the sides are not too high to be a challenge getting the food up and out of the bowl. The chunky spoon is perfect and the rubber rim is perfect at giving the grip needed to offset the pressure the scooping of food makes to the edge of the bowl. My little guy was an independent eater at 1 1/2 half, I should add the he has Down Syndrome and found eating with this bowl a breeze! I would suggest that the first time you give it to your child you stand behind the highchair and guide the childs hand to the bowl, scoop and bring to his mouth. I did this demonstration twice and he took right off!! He does throw the bowl when the food is gone, and it has never broken in almost a year of use.",1
"We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes.",1
"We have tried several products for teething pain management and this, coupled with ibuprofen when it gets really bad, works the best for our baby. Our pediatrician cautioned us against topical numbing products because they can numb the throat and tongue and interfere with feedings, a problem we did encounter with oragel. This product is thicker than other brands which makes it easy to apply and it seems to stay in place well enough to spot treat certain areas without accidentally numbing the entire mouth. Our daughter doesn't mind the taste, although this was not a problem with oragel either. We typically put this on after bottles, just before she goes to bed, and it helps her relax so she falls asleep more easily than without it. Look for the multi-pack on amazon for a better deal than you'll find in stores.Life with a teething baby is so much nicer thanks to little teethers.",1
I am very pleased with my glider. Was just as advertised. Easy to assemble. Works smooth as silk...,1
it is too loose for the mattress. The water turns black on the washer.,0
The bottle warmer does not heat bottles evenly. The bottles are either too cold or too hot. The bottle warmer has to cool down before it can be used again. If it did not heat the bottle enough then you have to wait before heating it again. Save your money. It is faster to boil water and then set the bottle in the water to warm.,0
I purchased two of these (8 segments each) in an attempt to babyproof my kitchen and living room. I like that I can move them easily and reconfigure it in minutes. This is particularly useful when we have company and I need to designate a safe play area for all the children. It is also great to contain the mess!,1
"This ia a convenient way to wrap your baby so they can feel secure. Just as snug as they were in moms tummy. Yes you can use a blanket to swaddle them as well. But, this swaddle me blanket is very quick, easy and snug for your baby and puts them right to sleep.",1
"Initially we LOVED this chest. After about six months though, the drawers started getting stuck, coming off track, for no apparent reason. While we still use it after four years (because of the $$ we paid - can't afford to replace it), we have to repair it and fix the drawers about every 6 months or so, just to keep it usable. Otherwise they become jammed and you can't open them. Do NOT recommend.",0
"My son who is now six months really enjoys this. We needed to work on getting his legs stronger. This is really helping. He will jump in it five to ten minutes at a time. He also likes it when his big sister helps him jump or swings him a little. It is easy to use. He enjoys the toys, or you can change them out and use your own.",1
"I have purchased this, but I found the design of the unit is really unsatisfactory and it is not performing as intented. I have purchased aMunchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmerafter this and the latter is a huge improvement. The main problems of Prince Lionheart warmer are the following:- Wipes are not warm enough. Because of this, when you take the wipe from the warmer to the butt, the wipe has already cooled a lot, especially in cool weather, which really defeats the purpose of using the warmer.- Only top wipe is ""warm"". I open the top compartment to access the pop-up wipes, but in each session I usually need to use more than 1 wipe, and if I keep the top open, when I get to the 2nd and 3rd, they are cold already. (and I am talking about 10 to 15 seconds between each wipe). This is weird because the heating element is on the bottom of the unit, which should make the bottom wipes warmer, but not...- The ""ever-fresh"" system is a sponge ""pillow"", and it is a consumable. It needs replacement, which is an unexpected extra cost. they are 5 dollars each and needs replacement every 3 months, though I've seen people saying they needed to be replaced more frequently because they brown out prematurely. They will cost you at least 20 dollars for a year.- Electric plug on back of unit sticks out an inch. What a horrible design! You cannot put it flush against wall, which I suspect is what most people want to do with their wipes.I'm not saying the Munchkin warmer has no shortcomings, but it makes the wipes warmer (but not hot), and there is no replacement parts, and you can put it flush against anything. I am returning the Prince Lionheart.",0
I am going to be a first time mom. I have done tons of reseach trying to find the best products for my new baby. When I came across these bottles I thought that they were going to be the greatest system. Boy was I wrong. I was dissapointed that they cannot be boiled. When I started to take the actual vent apart I became so frustrated that my husband had to come help me. The vent is very hard to remove but even harder to replace. There is no way I will be in the kitchen trying to put these bottles together at 2 in the morning with a screaming child. I will be sticking to the traditional Evenflo or Gerber bottles.,0
"With amazon mom and coupons from my Parenting magazine, these diapers cost me $15! They are well worth the price, my little guy has a history of blowouts, and these diapers have captured them all! You do have to 'prepare' the diaper before you jump in, but that takes but a second. I never find those nasty gel beads on him in these, and everything stays neatly contained where before it would go up his back and out the leg holes. Some have complained about the size... they are all ONE size, a little bigger than a one, although they work just fine for my tall slender 2 month old. I am very happy and have just signed up for subscribe and save with these :)",1
"This product seems to fall down easily and is not comfortable for my kids. In fact, both children have tried it and can't make it work.",0
"We bought this potty for our son, while he was potty training. At first he didn't want to stand up, but once I got The Peter Potty, it's all he uses. It's very easy to use and it's his own potty! We did have some trouble with it not flushing, but figured out that I was screwing the lid on to tight. I would recommend this potty for any little boy. Remember to dump the tray every night too.",1
"We used to love this product too. But... wait! Things have changed!Before you buy it, I recommend you read the reviews on the new Diaper Dekor Plus ""biodegradable refill bags"". The Diaper Dekor Plus used to be a great product, then they discontinued the regular refills and replaced them with an alternative that is getting terrible reviews.The new bags do not contain odor like the originals, they are more expensive and they are packaged in such a way that the ""green benefit"" is completely offset by the extra cardboard packaging required to buy 6 refills.Don't get duped by the OLD reviews. This product has changed and not for the better.",0
"This is a great buy. Our son is a little over a month old and he has loved this thing from the beginning. The vibration is perfect and the heartbeat sound puts everyone to sleep, inlcuding my wife and I. We actually have a similar product from Graco, which is good, but the Boppy blows it away.",1
"I ordered this gate from BabyAge but they never processed my Amazon transaction. Amazon contacted them and so did I in an effort to complete the purchase. I only got a reply from BabyAge after I told Amazon and BabyAge to cancel my purchase since I no longer wanted to do business with them.If you want this product then I recommend purchasing through Amazon but not BabyAge.We finally got the gate from Buzmart, Inc. since BabyAge failed miserably in order processing and customer support.I'm unable to change my 1 star rating to 4 stars but this is a pretty good gate. You'll really need to try to find a wood stud to secure the gate. Sheet rock just doesn't take the abuse of adults climbing over (to prevent the kids from seeing how the gate opens) and kids hanging or leaning on the gate.The gate was easy to adjust and install. We had to take a panel out and that was relatively easy.",0
We received the product promptly. It was exactly as it looks in the pic. I thought it was of very good quality for the price. It hasn't faded or shrunk with washing which is one thing that concerned me because the colors are bright. I would recommend this product.,1
"I bought this seat for my 1 1/2 year old son. The seat constantly fell out. I called the company and they stated that I must not have the straps in correctly. I made sure that the straps were in correctly, but the seat still fell out. They are sending me a box so that I can return the seat to the store. I wish that I had read the reviews on this product before I bought it. Do not buy this seat!",0

"I ordered one of these for as a gift for my sister's newborn as a Christmas present. It arrived with pink ink stripes on the right side and none of the electronics worked. Amazon was nice and quick about issuing a replacement, but the 2nd one had the same pink stripes just on the left side and the electronics still didn't work. I will be returning the 2nd and will not purchase any Summer Infant products again. I was embarassed that I gave this as a newborn Christmas present. I noticed a week after I bought this that the price was reduced yet again.",0
"the size scale is very accurate but it didn't really help much for me, i had a lot more issues then uncomfortable heaviness.",0
"I purchased the Snoogle Deluxe in my 5th month and can't imagine sleeping without it. I am a back sleeper usually and this prevents me from rolling over in my sleep. It is also big enough without being too large or bulky. I am having a very positive experience and can't say enough good things, however...I am only 5 feet tall and I'm not sure the pillow would be so great for really tall people. Just something to consider.",1
"I originally found out about these bottles about 10 years ago from a woman I babysat for when I was 12 years old. I don't ever remember her complaining about them but in fact she seemed very happy with the Avent bottles. Now, 10 years later at 22 with my first baby, my husband and I decided we would try the Avent bottles with our son. My son has been formula fed from birth and when I shake his bottles in order to get the formula mixed well, formula leaks everywhere. In addition, formula will leak out of the sides of the nipple which will cause it to drip down each side of my sons face and wet on his clothes. Most of the times I will see it but there are those times where I don't catch it and I have to change what he is wearing. The only, and I repeat ONLY advantage I have found to these bottles is the flow from the nipple. The flow from the nipple seems to be much easier on him than the Playtex VentAire bottles are. I have tried the hard plastic Playtex VentAire bottles and he seems to have an extremely hard time getting anything to come out of those bottles. So, I definitely say do not waste your money. I am glad I decided to come look for other parents' reviews on these bottles because I was beginning to wonder what the heck I was doing wrong to make those bottles leak so bad. Now I know at least I'm not the only one who has had this leaking problem with them.",0
"I'm not a complainer, but this thing was really a piece of ... junk. It arrived damaged. Amazon wouldn't take it back but they gave me $40 off. It took my husband a looonngg time to assemble, and he's a whiz at stuff like that (Ikea furniture, etc.). I'm just disappointed every time I look at it - save yourself the $ and trouble and buy something else.",0
"bought this toy almost 3 months ago and my 9 month old still loves it....:) the various activity things are interesting for the infant and successfully keeps her glued to it but the moving this is not much of a fun thing as it has no brake system ,so for the ones who are just learning to take a step or two , its not so safe as it rolls forward faster when compared to their ability..but as a toy i feel its very entertaining.",0
"No more diaper stink! The Diaper Genie is a hands-down necessity if you're using disposables. Open the lid, insert dirty diaper into the scented plastic liner, twist the inner lid a few times and the Diaper Genie converts your stinky mess into a neat package - all rolled up like a string of sausages. When the Diaper Genie is full, you simply cut the liner (cutter included), tie a knot, close the lid, then remove the full &quot;sausage&quot; from the bottom. It takes more time to describe than to actually do it. Everyone I know who has a Diaper Genie absolutely loves it.One thing to watch out for - it seems like Playtex has a production/manufacturing problem, because about half of the people I know who have a DG have had to return one due to faulty cutters or other problems. ** If you get one that doesn't seem to work, take it back and get another one. It's worth the extra trip, honest.",1
"I purchased the buggy bag last month for travel with my techno xt. I used it for the first time to gate check the stroller on one roundtrip flight (no connections). After returning home, I was dismayed to discover that the bag had already worn through the bottom near the wheels and that there was a 3-inch hole in the bag. I love the durability of my stroller, and I am very disappointed that the bag did not meet those same standards. I expected that the Maclaren brand bag would be of better quality. I contacted Maclaren and asked them to replace the bag. They refused and said that the tear was caused by stress that was not ""normal usage.""UPDATE: Maclaren contacted me and offered to replace the bag as a goodwill gesture.",0
"Look for something else, this things are too small for my SUV so I installed them in my car, they'll come off very easily even without anyone touching them, they even can fall on your baby, stay away from this.",0
"Purchased this to help keep track of multiple class projects and to hold documents while I type. Works well for sorting, and tucks away behind my computer screen when not actively in use. It is simple to insert documents into the holder, but this same simplicity allows documents to be easily knocked out. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It was inexpensive and it suits my needs.",1
"This is a great product! My files had been a mess, hand written (if at all). Now with a simple solution, I am neat and organized!",1
"I expected a bit more than was realized, having nothing but great experiences with Fluke equipment. I bought it to trace network cables and had no luck sorting out which was the target cable until I got to the termination. Even then the signal was faint. I suppose when I get more experience with it, I'll become more confident with it's behavior. Until then, I'll run other side-by side tests to verify my results",0
This key box worked well for me. I thought the price was very reasonable. It's pretty simple to put up and works very well for me. No surprises. It does what it's suppose to.,1
"This cabinet came in two flat boxes of sawdust, broken pieces of wood, cut particleboard and cardboard. The poorest quality cabinet I have ever seen and I have been to Wal-Mart once or twice. This is supposed to be a DVD ""safe"" safe? The cabinet was pressed sawdust with a cardboard backing nailed on. No where in the description does Spinkeeper tell you what materials are used to fabricate this cabinet. This cabinet is incredibly overpriced for pressed sawdust and cardboard along with a handful of nails and screws. Save your money and buy a real wood or metal cabinet. My unit is on its way back.",0
"I had mine for about a year, barely used, before it slowly got louder and louder. When I took it apart I noticed that it had plastic gears which were ground down to almost nothing. Now, when I see Aurora shredders, the words ""planned obsolescence"" run through my head. You might want to pass on these guys.",0
As stated by previous reviews this is a junk phone. My old Panasonic 900mhz was great and worked for years after being dropped a number of times.This phone has a horrible battery life and the individuals on the other end of the line constantly complain about you being hard to hear. I have tried everything and nothing short of shouting at the phone helps. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!,0

"I dont know why I cant find clic stics in stores, can only find the pens with caps on them & I dont like those. Have tried many different pens over the years & clic stics are the only ones I really like. Had to go thru about 50 other pens b4 I found these on line. I didnt want to order 500 of them, but a dozen is fine. I'm very happy that I finally have my clic stic bics!!!!!!!! LDC",0
"So many people have complained about short battery life, I felt it was necessary to post some basic information about the Ni-Cad batteries used by this phone:""Ni-Cad has a chemistry-related problem known as ""Memory Effect"", which limits the discharge capacity of the cell if it is not completely discharged during each use.""This means that in order to maximize the battery life, you need to:1) fully charge the battery for at least 15 hours before using handset for the first time (you only have to do this once)2) do NOT put the handset back in the cradle unless the battery is almost dead. This means putting the handset in the cradle ONLY WHEN NECESSARY for charging. The longer you can wait before recharging the batteries, the longer they will last.It really is a shame that panasonic didn't use another (better) battery type, but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy acceptable battery life... it just means you have to follow the two steps above. Once I got used to leaving the handset off the cradle, I realized it was much handier not feeling that I had to put the phone in the cradle all the time to ""top off"" the battery.For $30 (shipped, after $40 panasonic rebate), if you need a new cordless phone/answering system/caller ID box, this is a great deal and can't be beat!Edit: I've had the phone for 2 months now, and I still go over a week between charging the battery...(and that's using the phone daily!)",0
these showed up on time and fit exactly what we needed them to fit. there were no issues with the packaging,1
"I've had good luck using a variety of headsets with Skype, but wanted to see if I could free myself of having to put one on whenever someone calls. Unfortunately, I had little luck getting the MiniVox to work in an actual conversation. When I tried to record audio with, say, Audacity, the MiniVox sounded just fine, but as soon as I tried using it in a two-way conversation, my outgoing audio would be badly muted whenever I was receiving audio from the person I was talking to.So I tried a little experiment, and played music through the MiniVox while I tried to record some audio with Audacity. Sure enough, the record audio was chopped to pieces. I tried various settings, and even downloaded and used the MiniVox volume-setting software. No luck.Perhaps I've made some sort of cockpit error, and need to change my setup. But as things stand now, there's no way I can use this product with Skype.",0
"For years, this has been the only printer paper that I've used (to the point where I've been willing to drive 45 minutes from home just to get to the store where they used to sell it). I've tried many other brands, but it's amazing how yellow other papers look when you're used to dealing with 99% brightness. The 24-pound weight doesn't hurt, either -- documents printed on Navigator tend to have a bit more gravitas than documents printed on inferior-quality paper.Do yourself a favor -- if you're looking for quality printer paper at a reasonable price, go ahead and just buy this. You won't regret it.",0
"I got this ream of paper, but the package is broken, a corner of the ream was squeezed and distorted, nearly all papers' corners are distorted. How ever the quality of the paper is good, smooth and heavy. But I hate the delivery.",0
"I would never recommend this product. It was ridiculously difficult to work, and took me about a month to become familiar with this pocket organizer. I find it much easier, faster, and much more simple to just use my phone to keep my contacts and appointments. The SHARP WIZARD OZ-290HII was not worth the money. After about a year now, using it on and off in month-long intervals, ONLY HALF OF THE SCREEN WORKS. I cannot understand, or see anything on it anymore. I checked to make sure it was not near any magnets, and I have never dropped it. I do not have kids, and I was the only one using the device. No one could have accidently, or purposely, done this. I tried replacing the batteries, and that was a failed attempt at reviving my pocket organizer. I am considering buying a new one, maybe a PDA instead. I would definitly spend more money elsewhere, than waste it on this terrible product.",0
"How much can you say about a bubble mailer? Good quality, good price. This size is about perfect for the typical paperback book or DVD.",1
"Very unhappy with item. Had power but would not work plus, Three Handset item was only Two Handset so what the heck",0
"We've had three of these phones for over 2 years now and just added this handset so we could intercom our teen in her bedroom. Adding the songs and photos to really make this your own is a bit time consuming but I love knowing who is on the line based on the song/rintone that is playing. Even without customizing, the caller ID works well. Sound is clear and range is great even with multiple other wireless gagets in the house. Phone is lightweight and handset is comfortable to hold (one of my first criteria in buying a phone). The answering machine is easy as well. We've had no issues with this phone and would purchase similar product again but really can't see where we'll have a need anytime soon. Also battery life is very good. We often leave these off the handset for 24 hrs or more and only once have we had one alert us to low battery.",1
"I need rigid photo mailers to send out paper products that absolutely CAN NOT be bent in the mail. When I tried to find something similar in a typical office store, I was disappointed. I'm really glad that I found these here for two reasons: The Price, and very specific. I felt like I was kinda taking a gamble here, because I can't see it in person and touch it to see if it was of a high quality. I'm really impressed with these mailers. I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5, because I am taking just one of the mailers and putting it through some abuse to see what would happen if I put it through very excessive damage (water, forcing to bend it in half, dropping it outside in mud and running it over with my car, ect). Basically things that wouldn't happen during transit. I will update this review when I get done trying to ruin it. I might even post pictures so that I can share how it will hold up to all of that. So far though, it does NOT bend easily and I'm very confident that these mailers would reach its destination unscathed. Just curious that's all :-)",0
"The bluetooth paring directly to my bluetooth enabled laptop, the laser pointer, and the powerpoint presentation interface work well. I even like the magnifier feature which has actually come in handy once or twice. It's also nice that it has an on/off switch to save on battery life, and the carrying case is nice to have since it gets tossed around in my laptop bag. I've had it for over a month now and use it almost daily and have had no problems with it. My only complaint is the build quality. The latch for the battery compartment is poorly designed and thus within the first 5 minutes of openning the package I was having to decide whether to return it or fix it. Had it not been for the low price I paid on Amazon I would likely have returned it. My solution was to cut a piece off of a wide rubber band and use it for its spring action for the battery cover latch, which has been working fine since then. I am pleased with my purchase, so I recommend the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 with one caveat about the build quality of the battery compartment latch. I would give it 3.5 stars.",1
"We have had one of the full size Rubbermaid carts for years and it has held up extremely well. I wanted a smaller cart to carry classroom materials from my office to the room. It works great, is super durable, and does not take an engineering degree to assemble. It steers well and rolls easily across different flooring and sidewalk materials.",1
"I would like this labeler, except for the fact that as so many others have noted, it prints out very wide margins around individual labels. Because of this, I always have to reach for a pair of scissors and trim the labels. Each and every time. I don't want to have to think about this, locate the scissors and trim it up every time I want to use it. Because of this poor design, I would not recommend this system to others.",0
"My grandmother had a Kic-Step when I was a kid. I loved that thing. I was sooooooooooo excited to find it (many, many years later) -- AND IN RED!!!! It's safe, it's convenient. I LOVE IT and would buy another in a minute!",1

"This phone is so bad its almost funny...its not funny though it makes me want to pull my hair out actually.its not clear at all, like I cant figure out how to turn the volume down, if its even possible, or turn the ringer off. so it wakes my baby up all the time. when I press the numbers there is a delay, like it takes 2 full seconds to press each number. so annoying. and after I use it, if I don't go put it back on the charger within 2 minutes or less, it wont work!DONT BUY THIS PHONE! now I have to go find the time to go get a decent one.",0
"This is my favorite all around pen. It's not too heavy for my purse but has a quality, balanced feel in my hand and a soft grip. It appears that Papermate has stopped making it because it's no longer in their product line up on their website, so if you like this pen too, stock up now!",1
"The design of these highlighters leaves something to be desired. Long and bulky, the barrel of the marker resembles (and feels in the hand) like one of those plastic tubes that cigars come in. There is no grip and that makes using these pens uncomfortable when trying to highlight with the small nib.Though filled with ""Smear Guard"" ink, I still found that they still can smear (but not terribly) over a variety of different kinds of pens I tried. (Gel, ballpoint, fountain pen ink...) It was worse if you went back and forth over the same area of writing - which you may have to do because the marker nibs are so thin.On thin paper, these highlighters bleed through. Some of the darker colors included in the set like the red, dark blue & magenta are too dark for use as a highlighter, but could be used for annotations.I did not find any difficulty or smearing when highlighting a sheet of paper printed with ink-jet inks, though i did not try on a freshly printed page.As I am a writer that frequently uses a fountain pen, I'd love to find something that I can regularly use with water based fountain pen inks. I had hopes for these, but I guess I will have to revert to using dry crayon type highlighters.",0
"These poly mailers are perfect for mailing first class items (like articles of clothing) that weigh 13 ounces or less. They themselves don't weigh much, yet are tear resistant and protect their contents from moisture. Also, the self-seal strip is a very nice feature that provides complete closure.",1
"Moleskine makes the best notebooks, and the large, ruled is my go-to version. The paper feels crisp and clean. There's a pocket in the pack for stowing photos, etc. The elastic strap ensures that the notebook stays closed.

"Excellent pen. Writes smooth all the time. The needle point, and click pens from Pentel are ok but not as good as the rollerball w/ cap. The click pen and needle point don't have the consistency of the cap rollerball and dry out quicker. I've tried all the other brands and nothing comes close. The only pen I use.",0
I had to buy this product for the portfolio that i purchased for a student project and class. It was a perfect fit,1
"This is a great phone if you are just looking for a basic cordless. I've been very pleased with the reception quality and I like the simple, clean design without tacky, futuristic buttons that more recent models tend to have. There are a couple of things I did find annoying, however.- If your call requires a series of numbers (e.g. long distance call that has an access number followed by an actual phone number), you cannot browse the phonebook for subsequent numbers. You can still use the speed-dial feature, but you'd have to know where the desired number is stored.- The battery life is *way* too short.- The phone has this rather annoying beep for whenever any of the buttons is pressed, and there is no option to turn in off.",1
Well made microcut shredder. Securely reduces documents to unrecoverable confetti. Best protection for complete destruction of confidential documents.,1

Lower back is a small hole. Push a pin in GENTLY and hold for a second then release. Classmate bot hers from Office Max,at a higher price, it had same problem. Did the reset and now no problems. Great calculator. Gave it 4 star because of the problem I had until TI told me how to resolve. Hassle.",0
"DURABILITY.PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE.EXCELLENT LAYOUT....Durability...I am in the military and this thing IS my savior. I have taken this thing around the world with me, and in my pocket every day. It has a professional look to it while also being extremely durable (haven't ripped a single page yet and I've had it for 9 months). The pages don't fall out, and there's ample room to write lists and tasks. This thing has been spilled on, rolled up, folded, crushed, etc. And it still looks great and not a single page has fallen out!...Professional Appearance...While it's listed that this thing is 8"" x 10"", please keep in mind that's while it's open. Brand new, this thing is about 1/2"" inch thick. Closed, it fits perfectly in my uniform's cargo pocket. It has a a ""coat-hanger metal"" spiral spine and two black plastic/vinyl covers. The covers are textured and appear to be leather at a glance. I've received compliments on my planner and compliments because of my planner numerous times (ex: ""&lt;Name>, every time I see you, you are always doing something and are ready to take notes. I wish all of my troops were as organized as you. Where did you get your planner?"")...Excellent Layout...There are 2 layouts that come with this planner: The monthly view and weekly view. 1) The entire month is laid out when the planner is open (no bigger than a sheet of paper). Each day's box has 6 lines to write on, a note section on the side, and mini calendars on the side of the previous month and 2 months ahead. The calendar layout is AMAZING! 2) After the month lay-out, each week in the month is then layed out. Mon-friday have an area to write that's about as big as an index card, while sat/sun share an area the size of an index card.Also, every American/Canadian/Mexican holiday is included in the calendar, which is nice.The front of the planner has a course tracker (I do not need), while the back has studying/safety/security/job interview/resume/time management/how to find a summer job tips (they are actually pretty good), a grade tracker (which I used for finances...very useful), a numeric calendar, a time zone and area code map, and finally an important numbers section.",1

"Shortly after receiving it, I noticed the nib assembly seemed to be loose in the barrel. I was able to hand tighten it, but every now and then I would find it loose again. This proved to be an annoyance, and a flaw which I would not expect from a quality pen such as Cross.However, today, when I went to use it, I discovered the nib assembly has completely unscrewed from the barrel, and is now lodged inside the cap. I'm sending it back to Cross. Although their guanantee states FREE replacement, their website talks about a ""processing fee"". When a manufacturer produces a faulty product, I don't expect to pay a processing fee to get them to honor their guanantee.",0
I purchased this phone a month ago. I am not going to give the things I like about it because it would be a repeat of all the raves in the 4 and 5 star reviews here. I just learned today how to get it to send my Skypein number to the people I called for their caller id (I was under the impression that Skype caller id wasn't available in the USA). I have used the handset in my camper. That sends the signal though 3 walls of the house and the aluminum camper. I used it while I was in the garden today. Thats 1 wall and 150 feet away from the base. When I ordered the phone I was switching to cable from dsl and I had a lot of modem problems. The phone voicemail worked great when the system was down. I turned off my home phone yesterday and will save about 600 bucks this year (my cell phones are for backup).I had one problem with the phone. Once it locked in restart (not sure if it was phone or router). I unplugged the unit connected to the router and plugged it back in. No more problems. I would like for the phone to be larger and heavier (more like a regular phone). I would also like to find another handset. I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat. I highly recommend it.,1

"I have been looking for a replacement for my HP15c (Best calculator ever made!). I have searched ebay for over a year and came to the conclusion I did not want to pay $200+ for a replacement. I also bought a 32sII RPN... great RPN also...but of course...they discontinued that one... so again to buy on ebay was big $$$. I finally found the hp 33s. I am glad to find a calculator for under $50 that does RPN. It meets my need for standard engineering calculations. Does not feel cheap. Buttons of good quality. But still miss my 15c! Liked the HP 33s so much, I am going to order a second one .... since they will probably discontinue... and the price will go up again. I have not ventured into the graphing calculators... don't need that level of calculations. My son has one and loves it. Some day I will pay $100+ and give it a try.... But it is not RPN!!!! So for those from the early 80's who loved the HP15C...give this one a try... it is worth it!",0

"I have read the reviews in amazon.com and I have been wanting it for quite a while. When I saw it in one of those club store, I had to have it. I haven't tried very heavy load yet. I believe 150 lbs capacity seems realistic. Folding, unfolding can't be any simpler and easier. One thing I noticed, when I put a low profile heavy object, in this case 5 gallon water jug, I have to lean the handle very low or the weight of the load won't be directly on the wheel. Some kind of platform may work like a empty crate or box, but I haven't tried it yet. If you already have cargo tall enough like in the photo shown, it'll balance itself much easier.*update* (May-11-11)I had a opportunity to try the Max capacity test, 3 bags of pea gravel(50 lbs. each)First I put 3 together. It didn't lift without risking the base plate snaps off. The handle started to flex more than it should.Putting 2 bags together, little better than 3 bags on it but I didn't want to find out if it will lift or break.Putting 1 bag, it lifted without the handle flexing too much.I think 150 lbs Max capacity can be achieved only if the whole load is supported by both base plate and the handle. If the load is supported by only the base plate, even at the half the Max capacity can snap off the base plate. In order to move a 150 lbs. object, it has to be tall enough to lean against the handle, so the weight is distributed evenly between the base plate and the handle.",1
"I was very excited about this product, given the good reviews. However, I found that refilling the pencil took so much force that I was afraid I'd break it. Even worse, the eraser is useless, due both to the design and the material. If I could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better, this would be a much better product. If I have to carry this plus a separate eraser, it's not really saving me much.Oh, and the highlighter isn't a marker. Maybe I'm stupid, but I assumed it would be. It's just an orange ink pen, which is not the same as any other highlighter I'd choose to use.",0
I added this phone to my system. It was easy to program and works great....,1
"This is a great phone system. 2 lines, up to 8 handsets, voice mail, intercom, conference calls, etc, etc. So why 1 star? When it breaks, you're SOL.I've had my system for 4 years. Had a few minor problems, Siemens tech support helped, replacing a defective handset in the first few months. I was happy.All of a sudden, 3 months ago, all the handsets started having intermittent problems where the sound was garbled, in a digital sort of way (no static, just parts of conversation coming in and out a few times per second). I contacted Siemens, and their response was &quot;mechanical problem with handsets, we won't fix it, buy new ones&quot;. Huh? Mechanical problems, like you get when you drop a handset? But this problem started on all handsets, at once, and is intermittent. Doesn't sound like a mechanical problem, in the handsets or the base. More likely it is a problem with the firmware in the base unit.Talking a bit more to Siemens, I find that I can't just buy a new (8825) base unit, because the handsets I have aren't compatible. Great - so I have two choices:1. Buy a refurbished base ($130), and perhaps get the same problem 6 months from now, 'cause the firmware is likely the same, and Siemens will continue to insist the problem is a mechanical problem in the handsets. In 6 months, tech support for 2420 will probably be worse than it is now, and if refurbed units aren't available, I'm SOL.2. Buy a new base and handsets ($500). Since Siemens hasn't even admitted a fault with their 2420, how can I have confidence that they fixed the problems with the 8825? And if there is a problem, I'll get the same lousy support and incompatibility once the 16300 (successor to 8825 - just guessing on the number) comes out.I picked door #3. Goodbye.",0
"good quality cardstock, good brandname, better price. Arrived quickly and was packaged well. Darn these minimum word requirements for reviews anyway.",0
"This phone started out good, but the battery life went bad quickly. Had to replace a couple of the batteries on different handsets and they did not last very long either. The buttons do go after about a year. It gets to the point where you cannot turn the phone off and you have to remove the battery to stop the call. Between the batteries always dieing and the buttons sticking it was very frustrating to not be able to find a working phone in the house!!",0
"This sticky tack is not very sticky. It sticks the the walls great, but only until you attach a piece of paper to it. The paper rarely stays up! About half the time, there is blue residue left on the wall where the tack was. I do not recommend using this product.",0
I bought this shredder to replace the old one we used to death. It shreds as advertised. The autoshut-off when full is great. I would like to have a deeper wastecan for it. Great product and I would reccommend it for any one for home or moderate office use.,1
"This tape is a better grade than the cheapest stuff you can get at Staples, shipped quickly, above average adhesion.",1
I am sorry I bought this product. I installed it with updated drivers as other reviews stated to do. It made calls as long as I called directly from the Skype application on the computer. No matter what I tried would allow for the phone connected to the hub to make calls. The point of this device was to get away from the computer but that doesn't seem possible.Instead I have tried the Ooma system. It cost a pretty penny to purchase it but it is working like a charm. I figure after a years service it has paid for itself since the cost of the hub is my yearly phone bill. The added advantage is I can turn off my computer and still make calls. I no longer have a land line and just use Ooma. I use Skype for overseas calls but Ooma for everything else.,1
"As far as I know, the product works well mechanically. Time will tell since I am using it in a coastal area that is open air but not exposed to rain, etc. I was disappointed that the product had scratches on it. It was supposed to be new.",0
"This didn't get a good review from me because of poor sound quality. People's voices sound ""quivering"" and digitalized. If you just want something that's inexpensive and does what it's supposed to do then this is for you, but in this day and age of technology, there are much better ones out there!",0
"I want a good presenter and a regular mouse. I chose Microsoft because I thought it would support its own product. But surprisingly, it can't. I have to install a software to make it fully functional for presenter.If you just go to someplace to do a presentation, do you think you are allowed to install a software to other peoples' computer?As a mouse it is good, but as a presenter it is terrible. It also seems that if your laptop has a Bluetooth device already, the mouse's Bluethooth will interfere with it.",0
I purchased this product but soon found it did not do what it is suppose to do. Calls are not blocked after I gave the Tele Zapper time to work. I will send the product back.,0
"KEEP YOUR RECEIPT - AFTER YOU WAIT FOR 30 MIN ON HOLD FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WILL DO NOTHING FOR YOU WITHOUT YOUR RECEIPT IT IS THERE ESCAPE CLAUSE FOR THE POOR QUALITY PRODUCT THEY PUT OUT. AFTER 6 MONTHS MY EXTRA HANDSETS STARTED CLICKING AND POPPING, I CONTACTED UNIDEN AND WAS FRUSTRATED BEYOND BELIEF, LUCKILY I HAD MY RECEIPT SENT THE PHONES (0N MY DIME) TO THEM AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS THEY SEND ME TO REFERBISED FACTORY PHONES, BOTH DID NOT WORK, CALLED AGAIN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME TWO MORE, THEY NEVER CAME, WHEN i CALLED THEY SAID THE SECOND ORDER DID NOT HAVE A RECEIPT ATTACHED TO IT SO THEY DID NOT SEND THE PHONES, PS HAVE NOT HAD PHONES FOR OVER A MONTH AND STILL WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENTS.",0
"I bought this phone less then a year ago and when I first began to use this phone it worked perfect, I could even use the phone untill the end of my street. I could go to the neighbors house and use my own phone, I could go get the mail, and there was no static at all, I could hear perfectly. Then not even a month with my new phone and I started noticing static when I would go to far from the base (like 2 houses over) which was never a problem previously. It just kept on getting worse. And know less than a year from when I purchased the phone, it is totally worthless! The buttons barely work and to dial some of the numbers I have to push extremely hard. Everytime I step outside to get the mail or even just walking to my driveway, the static gets so bad that I can't even here the person on the other line. Then I have to hurry up to get closer to the base of the phone. It was a great phone when I first got it, so if you tend to buy a new phone every three months or so, then this is a good phone but it just doesn't last. So if you want a phone that will work great for long period than I don't recommend this phone, because this is not that kind of phone.I hope that my review helped anyone that may be considering this phone",0
"If you are looking for a small camera this is not for you. We purchased several for my daughters 10th birthday party. The girls all loved the idea of having a camera and we used them in a fun game. They were able to get 18 viewable pictures. The packaging says that you can get 200, but when we adjusted the quality to get more pictures most were so blurry they were unviewable and several came out as just colored static. Many of the cameras (we bought 10) did not center properly so the girls were getting just the top of someones head and inside unless the light was really bright the pictures were not clear. The camera was also much smaller than I had expected. I guess I should have looked more closely at the specs. It is about 1 x 2 inches.However all of that said, the girls had a good time and the cameras are pretty cheap for a toy. It did come with the necessary cable and software, so no additional purchases were necessary. And at the 18 picture level (factory setting) the pictures were not horrible for a kids camera. The girls loved that they come in silver, green, or blueDo not use this camera to take family pictures or anything that you really care about, but a kid would surely enjoy taking this camera to the park, a school field trip, or out to play with friends.",0
"I bought this item via ""today's deals"" and with the manufacturer's rebate, ended up paying only 5 bucks for it. That's one of the best deals I've ever found. My 8 year old uses it a lot as she's in a Spanish immersion program at school. It's easy to use and seems to have a large enough database of words.",1
Very nice book with excellent photos and tips. Good for europeans that can't suscribe to Real Simple Magazine.,1
The Burlington labels are equal in quality if not a touch better than labels costing 2 to 3 times as much.,1
"It's wonderful to be able to get these staples for the hand-held Swingline ""Hand Plier"" I've used since the 1980s! They fit perfectly. I've never seen a stapler I like better than my old stand-by so thanks for making these available for such an old, reliable product.",1
"Ridiculously difficult to use. I bought it to use RPN, and 3D graphing, which it does, but for everything else it is a waste. Unless you know someone who knows how to use it and can show you how, don't buy it. The manual is inadequate, the online .pdf is 900 pages and still doesn't tell you how to do simple things, like solve a linear system of equations. Buy a TI-89.",0
"I have to agree with everyone else on the reception...i constantly have clicking sounds and 'white noise.' If an appliance is on (such as the microwave), the noise is unbearable. Also, I usually have to pick up the other handset after 30-40mins of a conversation because the low battery signal will start beeping in. Very, very annoying. My husband and I have had this phone for 2 years and if we didn't have cell phones we probably would have thrown this phone out the window a long time ago. This is the worst phone I have every owned.",0
This is the worst cordless phone I've ever owned. I get static inside of my home. It's impossible to take outside. It's very poor quality. I expected more from a 2.4ghz phone. Don't waste your time on it.,0
"So far this has been an awesome pencil sharpner. I received it quickly. Most important it is durable, when I first received it all my kids were excited to use it. And of course one of them put the eraser end in first...but I was able to pull out the metal piece and it works just fine. Worth the money, wish I would have bought this before I bought the others.",1
"DECT 6.0 Expandable Digital the pasasonic has great battery life, 2aaa batteries, rechargeable, so simple, so smart. returned vtec 6.0, would not hold a charge overnight. instructions seemed straight forward, intuitive. only complaint, no backlight for key board. no big deal. great price on amazon.UPDATE: JAN 2012I have owned the panasonic dect 6.0 for over 3 yrs now. Never have had to change batteries. Good sound quality, not as good on speaker phone, but sp is great for waiting on hold, which we all enjoy. Even allows me to screen my calls.",1
"I bought the Panasonic KX-TS600W phone as a replacement for a similar, but 20+ year old speakerphone (without Caller ID). I figured it would be nice to have the Caller ID function built in. Well, I should have read the reviews first. The device does not have a port to connect a ""wall wart"" power supply, and runs off 3 ""AA"" batteries. Not only does the caller ID display run off the batteries, but you also cannot enter the ""speakerphone"" mode without batteries. But while the instructions claim you get 6 months of battery life, in practice I get 3 weeks or so at best with good Alkaline-type batteries. Since I am an experienced electronics technician, I was able to make a measurement of the current draw upon the batteries: 5 MilliAmps. At that draw, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you have drawn about 840 mAh per week.... you do the math, you would not get more than about 3-4 weeks on typical 2500-3000 mAh capacity Alkaline batteries at that rate. So I wrote a letter to the new Chairman and CEO of Panasonic Corporation of North America, Joseph M. Taylor. He referred my letter to a liason, Steven Robinson (551-482-8024). Mr. Robinson has been extremely helpful, and even sent me a new phone that was supposedly ""modified"" so it would run as advertised (6 months) on batteries. But I measured the current draw, and it also draws 5 MilliAmps, so it actually has the same problem despite whatever modification was done. We are still in limbo, and in my opinion every customer who has experienced this problem should contact Mr. Robinson and let him know that Panasonic has falsely advertised a 6 month battery life (and that 3 weeks is not reasonable battery life, you'd spend about $75 a year on approximately 52 batteries a year to keep a $30 phone running, pretty ridiculous!). My older (20 years) Panasonic speakerphone does not have an LCD display, but uses batteries to backup the programmed ""speed dial"" numbers, and the batteries last about 1-2 years. Panasonic should have designed this phone better, so that it runs either from the power of the phone line or alternately via a ""wall wart"" external power supply if absolutely necessary. Call Mr. Robinson, state your case. Maybe together we can all get a good resolution to this problem!",0
"I have never placed a product review before - but this is one of those products where I would NEVER buy again. The sound quality is horrendous. We have done everything thinking maybe it was our phone line so we replaced inside wires, outlets, etc. Another phone works perfectly but this one you can barely hear over the terrible static. Avoid.",0
This does the job! It seems pretty secure as it requires a bit of manipulating to undo the clasp. I had to use it to attach a key-fob to my keychain.,1
"You can use this tape just about anywhere, even on wood surfaces, as long as you don't mind the fact that it looks like tin foil. The main purpose is for sealing air ducts, which it is very good for, but it is a good all-purpose tape to keep around the house as well. Better than gorilla tape in my opinion, because the adhesive on it will succumb to heat and come off, this kind won't. Maybe the only thing better than this would be the super-sticky foil tape that is for leak repair (looks like chewing gum almost underneath when you try to pull it off).",1
"Well excelente mouse, easy to use, excelente support I have win7 and was easy download the new software for this.",1
"I've used these to print a few sheets of return-address labels, and I really like them.Ease of peel: Almost perfect. They do come off easily, but not so easily I can bend the paper back and get 10 off at once. For single-label removing it's great. Tearing off the side leaves a tiny bit of each label free, enough for you to grab so you don't have to scrape off every label.Look: I love how they are translucent. The ink stands out nice and sharp, and the address seems more clear. It looks professional and pretty.Printing: (HP LaserJet) No problems. I was surprised at how crisp the ink was, and how there was no smudging right after it came off the printer. (I'm used to getting ink on my fingers.) Also, using the 'Mailing Labels' 'US Letter Small' presets printing from Address Book (on a Mac) the labels were all printed right (makes my life easier).Price: There are labels you can get for half the price. If you do a lot of printing these may not be economical. But if it's for rather infrequent use, I favor the performance and look of these labels over saving a few dollars.I recommend giving them a try.",1
"Purchased this to use in my Canon MP 830 color printer. Using Canon brand colored ink. Printing full-color, photographic quality inserts for CDs. After 6 hours of drying time, the ink still smudges, sticks to facing pages and plastic surfaces, and peels off in smeary globs. Destroyed several beautifully labeled and burned CDs, and their jewel cases, in the process. Bought three packages of this stuff, which is now hitting the circular file. Never again.",0
"I was intending to use this in my crafting, but the magnets are not strong enough. Not keeping. This is the first Avery product that I haven't been satisfied with.",0
Great product and great way to get organized! I have magnetic containers that hold office supplies that I attach to the magnetic strip. It looks contemporary and is a convenient way to store items.,1
"Item shipped fast, delivered exactly what was expected, safe and sound. Would purchase from seller again. Thank you!",1
"I've owned this product for several months now and I did one unit software upgrade to ver 2.4.1. The software crashes quite frequently upon initialization. I had to contact support directly and I was told that this is a known problem and that I should roll back to ver 2.3.1 for better software stability. Sad to say, the older version is not much better.The Miglia website is totally useless, and if you try and locate software updates via the support link, you will be going in circles and not getting the information you are seeking. When I did get to speak to support about returning a defective unit(which they took care of in a timely manor), I told them about the issue back around August 1, and almost a month later, nothing has been done.This is a sad reflection on how much they care about the customer and I really doubt they are doing anything to improve their support website and/or the stability of their unit software for the Tvmini HD.Save yourself some grief and stay away from this product!!!This is purely an issue with Miglia/Elgato and not Amazon. I have bought other items from Amazon and have had complete satisfaction.",0
"Nice design on the unit. Set up was a breeze. The sound quality lacks clarity and gets a ""3"" out of 5. I really like the ability to set the unit on my desk at an angle rather than flat.",1
"Our typical document sizes are 20-200 pages with small runs (we use spiral rather than pro-click bindings for large documents), at relatively low frequency, so we couldn't justify spending thousands of dollars for a professional hole punch machine.This device is rated at 12 pages, frequently we have to cut that to 5 because sheets don't feed easily into the punch area. So you insert, if they don't go all the way in (you can feel the page margins bending), you pull out and slide in fewer pages, and shake the sheets a bit until they seat properly. It's very time consuming. I think there may be small shreds of paper at the punch holes that new sheets get caught on, or the hole punch surface area is uneven.Once the paper is in, it punches fairly cleanly, but pushing down on the handle feels like you're squashing a sack of potatoes, and the lever doesn't always travel the same distance, occasionally making peculiar cracking noises. Not a functional issue, just thought you'd like to know.Finally, this is a device that is designed specifically to put holes evenly along an edge of paper. But there are no longitudinal paper guides. So whether it's 8.5x11 or any other size, you're never quite sure if the sheets are all the way in and whether they're in straight. Over the course of using this thing, we've probably thrown a full ream of paper into the trash because the holes were punched at an angle or on the edge altogether (leaving a toothy line of half-moons on the edge). So then it's back to printing extra sheets, or even rebinding the document if you didn't notice the misalignment right away.The binding tool mounted on the top is marginally useful. Our device arrived with a bent slide on the top, so you can set up the comb and insert sheets, but we have to squeeze the comb closed by hand (which works just fine.) Perhaps others will find the slider-thingy more useful.I'd rate the entire contraption a ""one"" but, to be fair, it DOES work and it's reasonably durable and well manufactured (albeit with a quirky design). And the finished pro-click product looks very good.My next purchase will probalby be a different brand of punch with same hole pattern.",0
These notebooks are really popular for some reason and I do not understand it. The paper quality is very inconsistent and they are expensive for the quality. I have had two of these things and one had relatively smooth paper and one had horrible paper. If you write with a fountain pen this paper definitely is not for you. The ink with bleed and feather.If you want a nice notebook look into Rhodia and Clairefontaine...their paper quality is consistent and just about the highest quality writing paper you can find.,0
"My parents purchased this phone for us for Christmas last year. My dad is an electronics king, and loves to research to find the &quot;best&quot; of everything. Well, he was misled on this phone. There was always background noise, we could never hear the people we were talking to, and they could never hear us well.Also, the answering machine wouldn't stop playing unless we answered this phone. If we picked up any of the others in the house, it would keep playing.We finally just bought the cheaper 2.4 model ourselves and unplugged this phone and answering machine. Now it just sits here and looks pretty for when the parents come over. I definitely don't recommend it. I feel bad that they paid so much for it and it turned out to be such a bad system.",0

"This is an excellent calculator, particularly for engineering functions that require polar-rectangular conversions, where it solidly trounces even the TI-89 Titanium for convenience. Its two-line display is not as nice as the TI's larger screen, of course, but works really well, allowing you to enter complex calculations and edit them as needed, even remembering your previous calculations.The calculator has solar cell, so power is not an issue. With its plastic cover, it has been very durable over the last year and a half of being tossed into a backpack and used in all sorts of locations and situations. And at around $15 it's truly a bargain. It was recommended to the class by an engineering professor and I've used it college classes ever since; I bought another for my teen-ager to use in high-school math classes.The only thing close to a downside is that the ""manual"" consists of a fold-out poster of small-print explanations for various functions -- not comprehensive and occasionally incomprehensible. However, most of the calculator's functions are quite straight-forward, so this is a fairly trivial issue.I highly recommend this little gem of a calculator. What it does, it does well, and gives minimal fuss during the process.",1
"Came on time and in good condition, haven't had a problem with it yet and its been a couple months. Works great! Looks pretty too1",1
"Purchased this bag to make ""sand bags"" for shooting supports.This worked out great. Great solid quality, durable, and easy to work with.",1
This is pretty straight-forward product. Assembling the boxes was easy and it holds its shape. The faux wood look is a little cheesy and obviously cheap. I wish it were just a flat color. Price is great though.,0
I was unhappy with just about everything with this phone. It did not last long and did not work well at all. I had to replace it within a year. I got the Panasonic Model Number KX-TS600B Which I love and is giving me lots of years of good service with all the features I do need and like.,0
