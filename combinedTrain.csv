"We are happy with this purchase. The chair was not difficult to assemble and seems like it will be a nice piece to have as our baby boy grows up. Because it is a toddler rocker, it is a bit wide, so our son ends up tilting a bit to the side since he isn't wide enough for the chair yet and isn't quite strong enough to sit straight on his own. The recline and upright angles aren't very different from each other, but they work just fine.",1
"this stuff has saved my son from severe diaper rash.. For wipes, I use a non-alcholic witch hazel and use cotton balls.. it's really is amazing.. but i wish it came in a bigger tube!",1
"Great, great first toy. I have twins, and this has been a great mat for them to discover new things to do, such as grabbing, feeling, etc. It also helps them immensely with tummy time. Instead of getting frustrated, my girls look at the vibrant colors or the mirror on their tummies while lifting their heads. Fabulous gift!",1
"This is a very handy product to have. It has it's own carry case, which is a great plus. It's perfect for traveling to grandparents or even hotels.",1
"Love the stroller. Bought it because my husabnd is 6'4"" and had problems kicking all other strollers when trying to push. The Peg Perego has a stroller with adjustable handles for a tall/average height couple but it only changes the height a couple inches versus the Maclaren change of three inches. The stroller is lightweight, easy to fold and looks to be comfy. My only complaint is no adult cup holder and when you put one on it usually gets messed up while folding. Not a big deal but worth mentioning. I got mine in red for MUCH less than list price after searching internet. (Really liked the lilac but it was $100 more and I did not think a color was worth that much more money)",1
"I was a little hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews, but my 2 1/2 month old loves it and we haven't had any problems with leakage or anything. The flaps are a little pointless for her, but other than that it's really cool! I think it is absolutely worth the money!",1
"We bought this booster seat for our 4 year old, very slim daughter. Since she weighs 30 pounds I was looking for a very safe seat for her. She LOVES this seat. She feels like such a big kid. After using it for several weeks now, I feel very good about how the seat belt itself is not too high, and the comfort of the seat. She loves to unbuckle it herself when we get to a location and tells me the seat is very comfortable. It has been extremely easy to install and move around when we need to, and I am very happy with this purchase. The only possible negative I can think of is that you have to pay a little more for the girl print. I still don't get that part. She loves the colors, and I love how sturdy it is compared to the other boosters we have used. I would definitely recommend this product to others (and have done so).",1
"We purchased a jumperoo at the advice of friends, as our little one needed to do more than lay on her back or have tummy time while playing. We were glad to have selected the Rainforest Jumperoo--She loves it! She weighs about 20 lbs, so you have to be careful to get her feet through the two footholes. The seat is just right, although I don't know how much longer she will be able to get into and out of it, but it works fine, and she jumps excitedly for long periods of time (not just a 5-minute gig). It's nice for me when I need to do some work in kitchen.My husband wishes they made one for adults...grin!",1
"I bought this pail when I had my second child. I used the Dekor before and decided to try something different. This pail is great. It is very easy to use and doesn't smell at all. At first, my two year old decided to put everything in it because it is so fun to use, but she soon learned that only dirty diapers go in it. The only drawback is the the shoot does get pretty dirty and needs to be cleaned once in a while.",1
"We love this booster seat. It's simple, narrow (a plus for us, as we have three seats that need to fit) and the chest strap holders are attached. Absolutely love this booster!",1
We could not live without this. We traveled a lot with our daughter when she was between 4-10 months and this was essential for carrying her around airports to keep her safe and our hands free.,1
"Great for 18 month old. Cleans easy w/ no seams or crevices to worry about. Lifts up and sets in easily. Love the rubber around the foot print to stop from sliding or ""driving"" potty around tile floor. Very lightweight but doesn't tip over easily when little ones are practicing getting up and down. I have two - one for each floor of the house.",1
"We too, were thinking that we'd later have to use a rental or buy the more expensive pump but ,this one really does the trick. It's awesome, I take it to work with me and I'm able to store the milk right in the case. It's also quiet enough that everyone doesn't have to know when I'm pumping. This is a good buy, don't waste your money on the more expensive pumps.",1
"These bottles frustrated me at first, but once I got them &quot;down pat&quot; they have been great and I think they really do keep the air out and keep gas to a minimum. The early frustrations: the nipple is a little too big for a newborn, although he got the hang of it. The hole in Stage One is too small, even for a newborn, and made him suck WAY too hard..so hard, it left a mark on his upper lip!! So I made the hole a little bigger with a red hot needle tip. The bottom plastic piece (the &quot;vent&quot; piece) is a little tricky to get in place properly -- you really have to dig in there and make sure it's right or the bottom will leak (my husband still can't get this part right)...if the top ring/nipple leaks just pull the nipple up a little and adjust the tension of the ring. Sounds like a lot of work, and feels like a lot of work the first few days home when your starving infant is howling to eat, but once you get into the groove, they are great bottles. Playtex should make a few improvements, and also provide clearer directions with the bottles. I somewhat regret not starting my baby out on the Playtex Nurser Disposable system, though. It's too late now, because he is used to the nipple on the VentAir and wants nothing to do with several versions of the Nurser nipple, including the new silicone version that isn't as &quot;square-like&quot; as the latex nipple.",1
I recieved this pump from my hospital when I had my baby. I have to say I have two electric pumps one medela and one playtex and they all take out milk about the same. I use this pump when my baby is sleeping and I need to pump out some milk. The handle is kind of weird but it works really well.I prefer using the pump without the flexishield.I think any standard bottle screws on to this pump I use my medela bottles on this pump too. I recommend this pump for anyone who wants a easy to use and easy to clean product,1
"I purchased the Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame to use w/ my SnugRide 32 infant car seat. The stroller frame works just like a snap 'n go, is easy to put together and has a large basket just as pictured. It's lightweight and easy to get the car seat in and out of. I know I will get a lot of use out of this item once baby arrives. Amazon had the best price, very quick delivery and no hassles.",1
"This has to be one of the best strollers ever. I have the stroller and matching car seat/carrier as a travel system. Easy open, easy close, and very easy rolling (smooth as roller blades). Grandma is 76 years old and has no problem managing this stroller - she wishes she had strollers that rolled this well for her 4 kids. Lightweight for a full-size stroller. Very durable - still looks new after 16 months. Canopy is great for sun and wind. Large, easy to access basket. Boot is great in winter - throw a warm blanket on their legs under the boot and you don't have to bundle them up like the Stay-Puff marshmallow man. The reversible handles are great when your infant has outgrown the carrier but you still want them to face you in the stroller. New snack tray is a great addition, and as always with Peg Perego, new features can be retrofitted to the older models. Worth every penny.",1
"Beautiful piece of furniture, but my toddler grabbed a drawer on the side and tried to climb up to see in her drawer, and it bent the sliding rods. My husband had to man handle it so it would go back in the dresser. Other than that it's great- fits much more than the set I bought at R2G, and less expensive.",1
"This item is great! I bought this instead of the Bumbo seat for a few reasons.1.) This one came with a tray, toy, and 2 place mats for cheaper than I could have gotten the Bumbo seat with its accessories.2.) I like how when my daughter sits in the BebePod, her legs are comfortably pointing downward instead of straight out like the Bumbo seat.3.) I love the Kiwi color!!Others complained about a chemical smell - I never had that.A couple things I wish were a little different:1.) I wish the backrest was not so rounded at the top and I like how the Bumbo seat has ""arm rests"" in a way.2.) The BebePod is quite slippery and it looks like the Bumbo seat is not. (I've never even touched a Bumbo seat though so I don't know for sure.)3.) While the Bebepod is foam, it's a little harder than I expected. I'm curious to know if the Bumbo seat is any softer. On the other hand, I understand it can't be too soft or it wouldn't be safe enough for a baby to sit in it.But this product was great for what I was looking for! My daughter is 14 weeks old and so far seems to enjoy it. She's not quite coordinated enough yet to play with the toy, but I'm sure she'll love it.******UPDATE*********We absolutely LOVE the bebePod! Our daughter is 8 months old now and it's one of her favorite places to be! She ABSOLUTELY LOVES the toy it comes with and spends a long time contently playing with it! She gets so excited when she sees it coming!VERY HAPPY with our decision to purchase this over the Bumbo seat. We love how the tray slides in instead of just sits on top like the bumbo tray. So far, the toy has yet to be pulled out of the tray by our daughter, which is something I was worried about.I put her in it while I shower and get ready for the day, giving me all the time in the world!!BUY IT! You'll LOVE it!",1
"Length:: 0:36 MinsOur newborn used to hate tummy time until my sister got us this as a gift! Now he loves loves tummy time. This is him doing TT at 3 weeks. The best part is that this can be used for multiple things, like making the stroller cozy for walks. It is very soft and cozy. I wish I had one in my size!My sister also got us the lambskin wash too. The directions for maintaining the lambskin doesn't require it but it seems like a good idea to use. You should wash it once a month.",1
"I bought this for my 14 month old who likes to swing a leg over the crib rail like she's trying to get out. I hope this keeps her from being able to climb out for a while. Also, it gives her extra warmth without having to worry about keeping a blanket on top of her.",1
"Good price for a cute cover for your boppy. Not quite as soft as the plush covers, but totally reasonable softness--like a crib sheet. This design is not mommy-chic but it is baby-cute.",1
"This is similar to Avent wide neck bottle but I got this because this claim to be Bisphenal A free. Although BPA is not a officially banned, why take a chance. It's a little more expensive than other bottles; about $10 each. The only con is that there is an air venting piece which means more to clean but much easier compared to the Dr. Brown tubes. I'm glad that I could boil the bottles knowing that no chemicals are leaked out.",1
"I have an electric stove and for the big knobs it worked perfect so no one can just push it in and turn them on, but for the smaller knobs on the stove I was not able to use these. I would love for them to make these for smaller knobs as well, but for now i can just pull the smaller knobs off so little hands can't turn them.",1
"About a year ago, we looked at front swivel wheel jogging strollers. We wanted one with a supportive seat that would allow our son to sit more upright than most jogging strollers allowed. We also wanted one with a child tray. We opted to get the Instep Safari TT Single Stroller (which I think is the same as the Schwinn Safari TT Swivel Stroller) over one of the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Strollers. We were able to buy the Instep much cheaper than the Jeep. Also, the Jeep we saw had speakers for a cd player which we had no interest in using. We have just recently purchased a used 2003 Jeep stroller. For our current off-road, non-jogging purposes, this is working out better.I would like to offer our comparison of the Instep/Schwinn Safari and the Jeep. There seems to be a few choices in Jeep models. Ours is used and I don't know which we have. Therefore, these are just basic guidelines.We've taken both strollers around a neighborhood with sporadic sidewalks and no curb cutouts and both have handled the mixed/rough terrain well. We've also walked on the university campus where there are small (2') hills and both strollers go up and down them fine.My main complaints with the Instep, and what I like about the Jeep, are little things. The cupholders are so shallow that bottles of water fall over. The child tray is not removable. When our son falls asleep we have to lift him out over the tray. The sunshade is beyond stupid. We live in Arizona and the Instep shade provides no protection from the sun. It actually curves upwards. We bought a Kiddopotamus sunshade. Although it provides ample sun protection, our son must essentially look out a tube. I don't know if the Jeep sunshade will be better, we haven't used it for daytime walks yet. However, it seems bigger and does not curve up and let the sun in. I will address the bad Instep brakes later.The Instep is bigger and the seat for the child is roomier. However, there is more head clearance space under the Jeep Canopy. I wonder if the foot rest on the Jeep will be outgrown faster than the footrest on the Instep.The seat on the Jeep seems better padded. The one we bought was FILTHY when we got it and it cleaned up easily. I had been certain it would be covered in stains, but it looks brand new. The Instep has a thin seat cover that can be removed for washing. However, it is velcroed in place. When our son sits down, we have to hold the pad in place or it slips and wads up underneath him.There are reflectors attached all over the Jeep. The Instep has no reflectors that I've ever noticed.The handle on the Instep is adjustable, so you can make it taller. You can also position it facing backwards and be further back from the stroller. This is probably advantageous for joggers. The Jeep is okay height for me 5'7"" and I think my 6' husband is okay, but much taller and the Jeep handle might be too short.The back wheels on our Instep are bigger than the rear wheels on the Jeep. That might make a difference for someone who jogs. I haven't jogged with either stroller.Our Instep has a locking front wheel as does our Jeep. I don't know if all models of each brand lock or not.The brake system on the Jeep is better. Although they both have foot brakes that interact with the rear wheels, the Instep partially falls into place when you go over bumps. You then get a bump-bump-bump rhythm in the stroller. My husband actually stretched a bungie cord between the handle bar and the foot bar to prevent this. I haven't noticed the Jeep brake falling into place.I like the cargo basket better on the Jeep because it is bigger and much more accessible. Another advantage of the Jeep is for our son. He loves to push the stroller like he does shopping carts. He grabs the horizontal bar at the back of the stroller and pushes. On the Instep, this is the brake so he sets the brake. On the Jeep, he grabs and pushes with the cargo basket so he does not set the brake. The cargo basket on the Instep is very inconvenient. It's small and it is hard to get stuff in and out. I suspect for someone jogging, they would collide with the Jeep basket but not with the Instep basket.We've never used the Instep as a jogger, but rather as an off-road stroller. Now that I have used both, I think the Jeep is better for off-road general stroller, but the Instep is probably better for jogging. I still like the cup holders, sunshade, brakes, and removable tray of the Jeep MUCH better and think the Instep would be a superior stroller if it had those. Although I like the jeep cargo basket for my purpose, I think the Instep cargo basket that doesn't stick back, the handle that folds backwards, and the large rear wheels could possibly make a difference for a jogger.As of this writing, amazon does not offer the front swivel Jeep. However, it can be ordered from other sites. Some models are as cheap as $100 at some retailers.",1
"Great iteam,no odor ,I keep it in the babys room no bad smell you could use regular trash bags no necessary needs to buy special ones.A friend gave it to us cause his baby dont need it and still work as new...I was thinking to buy it at first when i saw it at the store...",1
I decorated my entire nursery with this theme and am so pleased I could not have found a better set than this one...I highly recommend this set to everyone...,1
"We've used this monitor for 4 months now.Likes:- very sensitive. Went off only once with baby in bed (because the sensor pad had been moved to one side of the crib after changing the sheets and the baby was on the other side of the crib)- can turn off movement sensor to just use sound monitor- gives me some extra ease of mind even though my baby is low risk of SIDS- has two receiving units- long enough range that I can take the receiving unit outside- receiving unit lights up when baby cries (nice for use while taking a shower)Dislikes:- only has 2 channels. Receiving units pick up static almost all the time from lights, computers, cell phone, you name it. However, we have not picked up our nextdoor neighbor's baby monitor.- hard to turn off receiving unit without loud static noise (not good for middle of the night feedings when you want your spouse to stay asleep)- need board over springs on crib for movement sensor pad- very senstive - the baby's ceiling fan on high moves the mobile, which is attached to the crib, enough that the sensor picks up movement even with the baby not in the crib. Also, adults walking around the nursery causes the sensor pad to pick up movement.- alarm goes off when you pick up the baby and forget to switch off the movement sensor",1
"The bag was a little stiff at first. The Graco car seat fits in great. It was easy to put in and remove from bag, it comes with a strap if you need to tote it around.",1
This is a cute curtain although it is an orange/pink rather than the pink it shows in the picture. My problem with it was that in the description it is supposed to be 84 inches long and it is only 55 inches long. Now I have to order a second one so that it will be long enough to cover my window. It does look nice in the window though.,1
"This is a great gate! Super easy to install! Unlike other reviewers, ours makes little to no noise when it closes. And our 10 month old son has been able to walk out of it without tripping over the bar across the bottom. The gate is very study and has a better ""look"" than many of the other baby gates. We are definitely pleased!",1
"This bag fits our Keyfit carseat and our Chicco umbrella stroller, which is nice because you don't have to pay for it when you check it! Wish the bag was padded but it is good otherwise.",1
"Our baby LOVES this bed! The attachable toy hanger is great for suspending little toys above her so she can bat and play with them. The bed is very sturdy and easy to open and close and comes with a duffel style bag for transporting. Very light weight, easy to move around. Colors go very well together. Great product!",1
"My 2 month old baby absolutely adores this mobile. Whenever we put her under it (it's attached to her crib, but she still sleeps in a cradle), she stares up at it with great interest. Even better, it often elicits smiles and laughs!Many reviewers are disappointed that the mobile doesn't move, but, personally, I don't think that's a problem. Sometimes I move the mobile for her, but it doesn't seem necessary. She's perfectly content when it's stationary.Here are some of the downsides:1) It didn't come with all of the pictures shown :/ We got two sets of the same pictures. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or if this is what everyone gets.2) Switching out the pictures is not easy--the holes are small and the cards are not flexible.3) The mounting arm, a huge chunk of plastic, is rather unattractive. It was, initially, kinda painful to install this in my daughter's otherwise adorable (and nearly plastic free) nursery. But. . . she does love it, so I'm over it.It's not a perfect mobile, but I'd still highly recommend it.",1
"I like that the towel is big, soft and absorbent. The only thing I don't like is that the monkey applique is rough and we can't really dry our son's hair with that portion since it's too rough.",1
"Why even wait to see if your baby is gassy...try these bottles. Most people complain about all of the parts, but there really aren't many and it's worth the few extra seconds per bottle to clean the additional pieces.",1
"This cover is great and we use it every day with our daughter. It really is quite warm - when our daughter is in the Bjorn her front side stays toasty, and this cover really keeps the heat in so we don't have to overdress her. In cold weather we just put on her jacket and a hat, and then this cover makes everything toasty. I only wish we could use it longer, as she's getting too tall!",1
"i loved this item, i purchased the sling which i also like, but was given this item, and used it a lot too. it keeps your arms free while the baby is very secure even when cant hold head up yet. and you can finally get some things done in the house. great back support, and baby loves to bounce around seeing all the action while being close to mommy. dont buy the more expensive designer ones, waste of money.",1
"Huggies are my number one diaper,they amaze me. They are super absorbent and my grandson has NEVER had diaper rash. That to me is amazing.",1
"I LOVE this product! We have used it in our king size bed and it is great!! No concerns as the baby is totally safe and she can smell me which helps her not only fall asleep better, but also stay asleep. We had tried putting in her carrier to sleep(which I hated doing) because the playard she was sleeping in was just too hard, I think, so once we got her to sleep she would wake up when we set her down. Now she either sleeps between us in our bed or in the Safe and Secure Sleeper inside her playard. Since it has a little mattress it's more comfy. Plus we use it to get her to sleep downstairs, then just move her (in the sleeper) up to her playard without her waking up. I only wish I had found this product earlier as my daughter is now 2 months old.",1
"I bought these so I could freeze breast milk. I wasn't sure if the ice trays that came with the fridge were bpa free so wanted to get something that was. Having the lid is a bonus. The only downside to this product is that even when filled to the brim each cube is only about 2/3 an oz but once you know that it's easy to plan accordingly. For just freezing breast milk, you don't really need a 2pk, but if I decide to make my own baby food I think the second one will come in handy.",1
"I bought this monitor at the advice of a friend. I am so happy that I did. Originally we were going to get one of those camera monitors, but I am so happy we changed our mind. I love the sensor board that goes underneath the crib mattress. It gives me such piece of mind. I don't have to go in there and check to be sure she is breathing every 10 minutes. I know that if she should stop, the monitor would sound an alarm. I know that it works because I have already removed her from the crib and forgot to shut off the sensor section of the monitor and the alarm is loud. I try everything I can to prevent SIDS. I believe that this monitor is just one more precaution I can take. I would strongly suggest this to anyone.",1
"I really loved the quality, haven't washed yet so I don't know. Ordered blue they sent me off white didn't have time to exchange since it was a gift",1
"We bought this jumper and Olivia really liked it but only for short periods of time. For something free-standing there is not enough toys to keep her entertained. She doesn't even bounce in it that much anymore at 7 months. We then purchased an older model that attaches to the door frame and she went nuts in that. I don't know why but she stays in that MUCH longer and seems to have alot more fun. So if you can find a nice one, I'd get the ""johnny jump-up"" model before spending on this. We found a new one for $10.00 at a second hand store.",1
"The play mat actually works great for our room. I like the colors, the thickness, the smell wasn't really strong, but had a ""new"" smell for a couple days.To help save on cost we bought them used through Amazon. And they actually appeared in almost new condition... Unfortunately I wanted two packages to combine them together to make a larger play area. It appeared from the picture that would be easy to do. However, when received we got two different versions of this product. One was exactly as we planned. But the other had finished corners so we couldn't attach them and they also had bigger connectors then the other one. Plus the colors were off and didn't look right.We are returning the one that didn't match, hopefully we'll get what we intended in the end.",1
"My baby and I both love these bottles. I started her on the playtex nurser but got tired of buying the drop ins and the wide nipple made her dribble milk out of her mouth.Since using these bottles she has not spit up once and she is less gassy. I have read that some of the reviewers claim the nipples dont work... there is a trick. The nipples are designed to be sucked at the tip not the base so when she is sucking on the nipple, I gently pull it out of her mouth and she gobbles it down.They are not difficult to clean. I just take them apart and throw them in a dishwasher basket and reassemble.",1
"We purchased this carseat cover for our third child, and I wish so much we would have had one of these with our two older children! This cover is the BEST--I cannot think of anything I would want to change about it. There are slits in the back that accomodate carseat and stroller straps; and the slits velcro close to keep cold air out if you are using the cover as a simple bunting. The fabric is really soft, and it has a removable hood to cover baby's face when bringing him out in the cold Minnesota weather. And you can also use your carseat's sun-visor with this model, unlike some the others I've used. This Wrap-n-Ride is also a lot less expensive than some other covers I've seen, which makes it a great value too. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a baby in cold weather.",1
I got this for my daughter and we've had it about 7 months. She's 11 months now and finally can use it without putting a pillow behind her. But it's very nice and we'll be able to use it for our next baby.,1
"I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him. This tub is great, I even use it at home. I started using this tub when my son was 6 months, he is now 9 months old. Now that he sits up on his own, it's a lot easier to bathe him. I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly, all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat. If you travel, it's a great idea to get an inflatable tub, it's portable, and quite sturdy.",1
"My son is fascinated with this mobile. He smiles and coos as he stares up at the pictures. I love that you can change out the pictures to keep it fresh and new for the baby. My only complaint is that the cards are a little hard to change out, and some of the cards can't be moved down so the baby can see them. I wish all the cards had the middle slot to put them in the baby's eye line. Overall, though, this is a great mobile and I would reccomend it to anyone.",1
"I don't mind the odd shape of this shawl so much, and the thumb loops top and bottom are kind of handy. However, the thumb loops are absolutely necessary, because my daughter could easily pull it off otherwise (because it was so short). It also gets VERY dark in there unless I continually hold the top loop away from my body, which makes my arm tired pretty quickly.I went back to using a light-colored large baby blanket - it provides better coverage, and my daughter doesn't try to throw it off, because she can still see.",0
"One day recently, at 11pm, long after we put out 10 month-old to bed in his crib, we hear ""The sun is shining..."" coming from his playroom. Then 11pm, 12am, 1am... you get the idea. We have had the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker for since Christmas. His interest is minimal for this toy. I would like to say it's educational but I'm in reality on the fence about that statement. It hardly keeps his attention, and the voice is hard to understand - so how can he really learn? All he cares to do is eat the phone and pull the shapes of the mounts. I thought it was a good toy from the description and design so I requested it as a Christmas present. I can say now after 3-months of use, I don't like it much and wish I had asked for something else.",0
"After trying for a half hour to figure out how to lock the tabs in place, we thought we had it figured out - the tub then literally gushed water all over the table. We tried to give it a chance 2 more times and it still leaked. Tried it inside the bathtub and all the water leaked out - poor baby. Do not buy this, it will only make you mad and be most unpleasant for your baby.",0
"I requested this sheet on my registry. When I received it I was quite disappointed at how flimsy the sheet was. I also didn't care for how easily it comes off of the pad. I ended up putting a blanket down for my baby to lay on because I didn't trust that the sheet would stay put. Also, given how thin it is, it would take only a few minutes for a pool of drool to end up on the pad itself. I was very disappointed.",0
"We bought this product for a 2000-mile road trip with our 14-month old. We found it was too thick to be helpful in keeping her head propped up in a good position as she slept to prevent wheezing. If we put it around the back or sides of her neck, her head would fall forward and her breathing wouldn't be smooth. If we put it around the front of her neck, it wouldn't stay put or she would pull it off. On the positive side, it worked reasonably well for me and my 16.5-inch neck, but we will be looking into something more wedge-shaped that goes around the front of the neck for the next trip with our toddler.",0
"I think this could be a good monitor except for the 2 way communication feature. Just as with many monitors you can pick up interferance on the parents end,but since the childs end is also a reciever it picks up interferace as well. We have been trying to use it for a week and the monitor in our sons room picks up phone conversations in the middle of the night which of course wakes him up. Not a good idea!",0
"I am ready to buy new monitors. Not only have the receivers always had static and feedback but after less than a year use, the one contact for the receiver is bad. Depending on the position of the cord, the receiver disconnects and therefore, is not very helpful in monitoring my son. I really dislike the amount of 'white noise' both receivers produce. We have experimented with moving it to different outlets and different positions in our house and it is NEVER quiet.",0
"My kids are 32 months apart and this stroller did not work well for us. My 2 year old hated sitting in the back seat. The front seat poked her in the back when the car seat was in it, she hated riding backwards and she had no where to nap if she was tired...running errands was awful!! The carseat converter was hard to take on and off (I pinched my fingers all the time). The front seat hardly reclines and is not soft at all...which means no napping in this stroller! It is bulky and heavy. I sold it after 6 months and bought the maclaren twin triumph stroller (which I love).",0
Out of all the baby products I have received this tub HAS TO BE THE WORST! The major problem with it is it leaks all over the place. The directions are so hard to understand in the first place and it was more trouble than it was worth to put together! I have used it a couple of times and am ready to throw it out the window! I will be investing in another tub - hopefully one that does not leak!!!!!,0
"My husband often dreams of how he will dispose of this monitor. One of his biggest complaints with this monitor is that the lowest volume setting is very quiet and the next volume level up is very loud. From there, it just gets even louder. Most every sound is distorted and a bit frightening. Our first one broke and we had to have it replaced... he thinks we should have just bought a different model a long time ago. That said, this monitor has really helped to teach him patience, so it can't be all that bad! ;-)",0
the head support doesnt fit to my car seat. my baby head is squeeze and i guess it only fit in the stroller. i like the touch of it but i have to return it .,0
"Recent changes in the absorptive materials in the Pampers Swaddlers caused a rash on my little one's 'tushy'. Have switched to the Fisher Price brand, available at Amazon and Babies R Us. I am totally happy with the switch.",0
"...very, very hard to clean. There are cheaper high chairs on the market now with similar features. Don't be fooled into paying more for the Perego name. It's just not worth it.",0
"I really wanted to like this carseat but after 4 months of using it, I can't recommend it at all. With my older daughter, we used the Graco Snugride which was great over time - lightweight, clips into everything, good shade, roomy - but she hated it for the first couple of months and we thought it wasn't comfortable enough. So this time around, we looked for a carseat that looked comfy. This one certainly seemed to fit the bill - the fabrics are high quality, there is a lot of padding, and it includes the Mother's Lap insert which seemed great. I do think that the carseat is well padded and comfortable in that sense. Unfortunately, all of the padding and especially the temperpedic-style foam padding makes my daughter extremely hot. She is dripping in sweat when we take her out of the carseat. Overheating is very unsafe for newborns.It is a constant annoyance that the carseat won't clip into shopping carts and I have to set it in the body of the shopping cart leaving no room for items. The sunshade is way too small and doesn't cover her at all and also comes detached all the time. Whenever you try to rotate the carseat handle, the sunshade is in the way and I end up trying to cram it under the handle and then it comes detached.All in all, I have been extremely disappointed by this seat and if she weren't already almost out of it, I would have switched back to Graco.",0
"This is the worst. We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months. Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor. It isn't even in the same league. With the voice activation feature you hear nothing, I repeat nothing, unless the sound registers over a certain decibel. Amazing!! It was definitely worth the $50. Just wish we never registered for this product.",0
"The material used in the current line of Peg Perego car seats is neither breathable nor absorbant. My daughter sweats terribly. Her head is dripping when I take her out of a climate-controlled car. (She was not overdressed.)Also, the plastic housing around the harness adjuster has cracked after limited use.The company would not refund my purchase price. The manager suggested I sell the car seat and stroller on eBay or at a consignment shop! I would not subject other children to this product's numerous faults.",0
"The idea of a hands-free gate is great; however, the plastic foot pedal on this gate broke in the first few weeks after installation. We fixed the pedal with duct tape and were able to use the gate for a couple months thereafter. Now, one of the two plastic tabs that secure/lock the gate closed is jammed inside of the gate and the remaining tab is too flimsy to hold. I will return it for a different one as soon as possible!!",0
"I really like the functionality of this high chair. It came with all the pieces and was easy to put together--it is sturdy. It is also pretty scratched up and had some decent gauges in the wood. The finish of the seat was rough and low quality. We would have returned it, but we needed it ASAP and were in a jam.",0
"I was going on a trip with my 3 month old across the county and bought this for the plane ride. As far as heating bottles, this does not work at all. You have to boil the bag after each use and let it cool down completely before trying to use it again which is a real hassle. It also activates when you don't want it to. Most importantly, it doesn't heat the bottle at all. It's a neat product, and I would recomend this for using as cordless heating pad for your sore muscles...but not for heating bottles.",0
"This wireless video system arrived and seemed perfect...until I turned it on. Our house is full of 2.4Ghz stuff like cordless phones and a wireless network. Sad to say the receiver didn't function well at all in this environment--so many static lines and jumps that it was virtually worthless. Other than the fact that it was not designed to operate with simple wirelss items that the majority of American homes now have, it does seem to be a sweet little wireless video system. Perhaps if you live in a vacuum in the middle of no where it would be perfect to keep an eye on the local wildlife... :O)",0
"I was looking for baskets for the changing table of my son. This set looks nice online, but they look different in reality. The liners are very DIRTY with faded color, and the basket material is very weak with yellow stains.",0
"I can't believe so many products, for babies' sensitive private parts, have shea butter! You do not know if your child is going to be nut-allergic...so don't use products on the child that contain shea butter! I am allergic to nuts and any personal care product (lotion, wipes, etc) that contains shea butter gives me horrible hives. If your child gets a fierce diaper rash using these, consider the possibilty of an allergy..or better yet, don't use nut products like shea butter (which comes from the shea NUT) on babies when you don't know if they will be allergic...exposing them repeatedly so early on to nuts may trigger a nut allergy due to ""system overload.""",0
"Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, ""unacceptable"" because it's unsafe. (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.) Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay. Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should. CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling. Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store. Be sure to avoid model 14565!",0
"Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed.",0
"My son is 2 1/2 and this potty has been a nightmare for us. First, it did have a tendency to go off at all times of the day and night, and 2nd, the splash guard is not tall enough or secure enough. I can't even begin to count the times that I've turned around and seen him chewing on the guard he's removed or how often urine has shot across the bathroom because his penis is pointing 1 cm off of 'straight ahead'. On the bright side, it's comfortable for him to sit on and mine has never leaked, but that just may be because the urine never quite makes it in the receptacle.",0
"I own one of these things and have used it once. To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain. Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks. It is also not very lightweight. I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down. I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road. And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water. Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing. I wouldn't buy it again.",0
I dont know if it's just me or what but I found this belt to provide no extra support what so ever. Save your money or invest into a belt thats worth it.,0
"My daughter had an allergic reaction to this product--a rash on her lower back the morning after she wore the Goodnite the first night. We tried again the next night, and the rash became worse (she stayed dry all night both nights). We tried using the Goodnites a few nights after that, putting a pair of underwear on her first and then putting it over to protect her, but the Goodnite caused a rash anywhere it touched her lower back where the underwear wasn't protecting her. Just want to add that my daughter has never actually had an allergy to anything before that I know of, and we've used a lot of different brands of diapers.Also, don't be fooled that this will look like underwear in any way, this looks like a soft fluffy pull-up. When we took them out of the wrapper, my 2 year-old said ""that's a diaper! that's a pull-up"" and my 4 year-old was only willing to wear it because there is a picture of an older girl on the package.",0
"I tried this product based on the convincing positive reviews. I am very disappointed. This thing is so hard to operate one-handed. I don't like to leave the baby on the changing table for even a second, and with this device you have to have both hands to push diaper in, and then twist. I just set the diaper half way in now &amp; hope that I remember to push it through, and twist it when I have a spare minute, but it's a pain. I know a bunch of other mothers who also have used the genie, and were not impressed. I wish I would have taken their advice in the first place.",0
"I love this brand of bottles but, buy the thinner bottles. The wide Dr Brown bottles cost more and were to big for my daughter. The other nipples were better on the thinner, tall Dr. Brown bottles. Easier for a newborn to eat from the thinner bottles",0
This item looks great but is cheaply made and isnt even safe for your baby. The red wipes case transfers red color to all your wipes and when you report the issue to the company they do not care. They delete your posts on their facebook wall if it doesnt favor them. Do not buy this product or any skip hop product for that matter. Your baby deserves to use products made by a company that will stand behind their product and that actually cares about the welfare of your baby.,0
"#1 this stroller does not fit in any car#2 do fold it, you have to remove the seats#3 it is extremely dangerous. they have to stop selling it. the stearing mechanism broke at about a year. luckily my wife was a block away from the house and the neighboors had to help her bring the kids home. imagine being stranded far away!!!4. the turning radius is extremely wide. you have to move back and forth, left and right 2 or 3 times before you can make a turn",0
I only used mine once. It got ripped up on the return flight trip. Don't know if its the manufacturer or the airline's fault.,0
"I bought these cups because I thought the idea of no valve was excellent....however, I quickly learned that while it may be a good idea, it was very poorly executed in these cups. I have purchased (and returned) 2 packs of 2 because all 4 leaked. I thought maybe the first set was just a fluke...Nope. These cups are NOT spill proof. They aren't even drip proof! The return air valve leaks profusely on all of the ones I tested. I do NOT recommend these to anyone!!",0
"Don't bother buying this matress pad. It leaks right through it, on to the sheet!",0
"When I purchased this stroller, it sounded perfect. We took it out for a walk on the beach, it was impossible to turn and steer. This was a second stroller for my three year old boy - our Peg Perego Aria - although dirty and old works so much smoother. My husband has tried this stroller out too and told me to toss it or give it away. Don't waste your money!",0
"This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out, and NO shower pull-up handle (look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations.) On top of that, this cover is too short for any of our spigots!One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover, the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front.This cover won't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle. If your spigot has a flat-top shower pull-up or it can be unscrewed, then perhaps you can make this work.AND it's too short! When the cover is on a spigot, the back of the cover won't meet the tile wall, which means it can't be caulked into place, which means it is easily bumped out of position, spewing water everywhere, or perhaps worse, falling off the spigot entirely. No good!This product should have been designed to accommodate more styles of spigots.",0
I have to agree with everyone else. This monitor is horrible!!!! I live in a busy traffic area and I am constantly listening to people's phone conversations. I even picked up a police radio once. Save your money and buy something else.,0
"I'm just over 5'3"" and I absolutely could not use this sling. It just was not comfortable. The strap seemed to hit me in the wrong spot on my shoulder, and it just hurt. So I returned it. It does seem like it's really well made. But I thought that it was maybe a little too heavy even before I tried putting my daughter inside. I ended up finding a pattern online and sewing a basic pouch sling myself using trouser-weight fabric.",0
"The products don't come with a ""snack over lid"" or the lid. As a result of that, I had to use plastic wraps to cover the snack trap to prevent dirt/dust from going into the snack trap. I finally attempted to order the lids online and had trouble doing so because they have a very bad website. Well, I wrote and called and got no response from the company. What is the point of getting the snack trap if it doesn't come with lids? The product is poorly designed. I wish I didn't spend my money on it. What a waste!",0
"This monitor has a tendency to pick up interference from different appliances being used in the house. Fans, lights etc. Our big screen tv renders the product useless -it just puts out static. The voice activated feature pops when used, very annoying. We ended up disabling that feature (and that was the very reason we bought this model). Extremely disappointed with this product.",0
"I'm the type of consumer who rarely writes a bad review, but these diapers deserve it, especially for being Pampers brand and not just a generic. The mesh inside the diaper sticks to one side and completely rips apart when you try to separate the mesh from the side of the diaper so that you can place your baby in it. Pampers is still a great brand, and we've never had a problem with them before, but steer clear of this particular product. Poorly designed and LOW quality.",0
This belt positioners is no replacement for the security and safety afforded by a federally certified booster seat. This belt positioner allows for too much movement on the part of the child and is not able to keep them properly positioned in the adult seat belt system. If your child is too large for their car seat then spend the few extra dollars and purchase a belt positioning booster to make their ride more comfortable and safer.,0
"About two weeks after sending the last of my easy to use First Years baby gates to the Goodwill, we decided to get a puppy. I looked around for those same baby gates, but couldn't find any. I found this gate and, while it is absolutely hideous, it's was cheap, which is good since I didn't know how long I'd need it for.I realize some people here have found this gate easy to use, but I am not one of them. I can't imagine how people are able to operate it one handed. Sure, it's easy to unlatch and remove from the door frame one handed, but setting it back up is a challenge. Maybe it was just my particular gate, but it didn't slide easily AT ALL. It took quite a bit of effort to pull the one side out to make it larger, then I would have to carefully tap it down to the size I needed so it would fit the door frame again, since the four rubber stoppers prevented me from just slipping it back into the doorway. At first I thought it was just me, but even husband, a naval nuclear engineer, struggled with it...so that made me feel better. Again...it may just be our particular gate, but my experience with it has been mostly negative.In the end I'm glad I went cheap because we ended up not really needing it (puppy is kept in the bathroom at night with the door closed instead of a gate up), but we'll keep it around just in case. If you're planning on using this for a child, I say pass...unless you're going to put it up in a doorway and leave it there. In that case it's a great gate because it's so cheap. But it your planning on removing it frequently from wherever you put it, look elsewhere.",0
"Let me emphasize how HORRIBLE THE RECEPTION ON THIS THING IS!! We bought it a week ago and have been playing with it to get it to work without sounding like an static-filled air control tower. Moving it from place to place, etc. My husband and I have not rested well since we bought the damn thing. Last night we even got in an argument, half-asleep in the middle of the night because that stupid thing just flared up and got all loud and static around 2 a.m. Even if we turn on the PS2, the TV or god forbid talk on the phone or walk by it...forget it. Now, here we go again back to the store........don't waste your money!!",0
This chair is such a pain to move anywhere. I would like this chair fine if I didn't want to move it around my kitchen. The brakes are constantly being pushed down by the covers of the legs and I can't get it to roll. I don't personally use the brakes yet because my daughter doesn't move it. I have been trying to contact Graco to see if this is a common problem and what they will do to fix it.,0
"I set this gate up at the bottom of the stairs in my house, but from the start, it didn't feel very sturdy. The metal parts are nice, but the locking mechanism is mostly plastic, and made very poorly. I have needed to tighten the gate at least once each day during the four days it has been installed. If it is a little loose, it pops open with a little shaking, which my 18 month old has already done. We are shopping for a new gate.",0
I didn't think these bottles were that great. My child isn't collicky and doesn't have digestive problems so maybe I would rate this item differently if she were. I thought maybe she would burp or spit up less with these bottles compared to regular bottles but she didn't. Plus there are more parts to clean. My husband hated them after the first couple of tries but I wanted to give them a chance. So after a couple of weeks I also gave up on them and use them as regular bottles instead of attaching all the parts. Save your money and get a different brand.,0
"I purchased this stroller for 2 based on manuvarability and stability.. I could not have picked a worse choice!! Within 30 days, the fabric was ripping, it is lighter than most strollers for 2, yet this is not as convienient as it seemed. The wheels have to lock in certain positions, the basket is lightweight and very unaccessable and it does not have a kick bar (the bar in the back of the stroller to help position to go up curbs, the one that you lean your weight on). When the front is reclined, the child in the fronts feet and legs are being squished. The sun shades / hoods are not easily moved to position for shade.Amazon has agreed to take stroller back.. I'm extremely happy about that!!!I would not recommend this product at all..MOM of TWINS..",0
"I don't know if it fits better on another brand of car seat, but the fit on the chicco keyfit, is all wonky, it doesn't cover all of the top, and it runs quite short. We were up in Conn. during a snowstorm over Halloween weekend recently, and being from VA, i wanted to make sure she stayed warm, so i got some tight and this to supplement what clothes i had with me to keep her warm. It did keep her warm, but it doesn't even go to the end of the car seat on either end, and my husband hates to try and buckle her in with it as he has a hard time find where straps have gone, its a good thing i don't think we will be using it long as shes over 6 months now. I posted pictures because i wanted to see how they fit before buying one initially, and nowhere did i find pictures of them on different brand seats.",0
"My husband wanted this and I totally poo-pooed it at first. But the itz-been is so simple and exactly what new parents need! when you're not sleeping and can barely remember when you last showered, and it seems like you are feeding or changing the baby every other minute this is great at helping you keep track of things. It's especially great before you discern your baby's cries - I learned that if it wasn't 2 hours since she was fed, chances were the baby wasn't hungry.",1
I was skeptical about getting this tub especially after reading the reviews that said that tub leaks. I found one good review and I got the tub anyway. The first things the instruction booklet said is that the tub must be open to the fullest to prevent leaks. I have not had a problem with the tub since.,0
"After reading the reviews, I decided to get this and am so glad I did! The mirror is nice and big and I can see my entire car seat and baby, it stays in place well, it was very easy to install, and so far seams great quality.",1
"I bought these for a gift and they came in a reasonable amount of time. In time for our baby shower, and my sister in law was very pleased to have received them. Baby's not due for another couple months but thank you!",1
Whatever my baby may think about the sounds I don't know. The light is helpful. But the frequency of battery purchases makes this noisemaker a waste of money. Buy one that plugs into the wall. Oh yeah...the sounds are not that good either.,0
"I love the feel of the terry cloth but the cover shrinked at the first washing!! Also, it is starting to unravel and strings are poking out everywhere! Color selection is great, but that's it!!",0
"By far the best wipe on the market. My daughter has OH SO VERY sensitive skin. When she was a newborn, we went through every ""sensitive"" wipe on the market and she kept getting a rash from them. We finally swiched to 7th Generation and have had NO problems. As far as I can see, it is the only wipe that can promise there is no chlorine used when processing the wipes. She's now 2 and has a little brother. This is the ONLY wipe in our house. Plus the subscription on Amazon makes them the lowest price I've ever seen.",1
"I do not own this item but I tried it out in the store and it HURT my shoulder!!! The shoulder strap is too narrow, it digs in, and I only had it on for a couple seconds. I went with a New Native pouch and I LOVE it!!!!",0
"I purchased this swing for my third child, who is 1 month old. I liked the design and toys of the swing. The different speeds and music is what made me decide to buy this swing. It was very easy to put together and to fold up. The bad thing about this swing is that there is no back or head support. My baby's head goes to side and seems to be uncomfortable. I'm actually going to return it for a full size swing.",0
"Although I just had my fifth child, this is actually my first jogging stroller, and my first double stroller. I bought it mainly for my 2 y o, and he loves it! And i'm glad that when the baby is bigger, I can go on long walks with both of them with ease. There is no comparison between the jogging stroller, and my regular stroller. It pushes easily, even over rough sidewalks or grass, and has a pretty good sized basket for a jogger. If you need a double jogger, you can't go wrong with this one!",1
Decent item for light duty use. Has a little lever action to ensure a tight fit.,1
The thing about this strap is that it uses the latch system on the car seat. So you have to adjust for the suitcase. Then adjust for the car. Then adjust for the suitcase again. I am travelling alone with my son. There is no way one person can work this. So unless your going to be traveling with someone I do not recommend it at all.,0
"Ok, maybe I'm partially to blame as I did NOT look at each of the color samples. After receiving my chair almost 2 WEEKS LATE it was not cherry wood as I would typically think of it. It appears as more of a walnut stain. Not exactly what I had hoped for. In addition to this, the tray was damaged and could potentially pose a choking hazard. We all know how little fingers like to pick at things and a piece of the splintering wood could have chipped off and been swallowed. Or been a splinter to remove from little fingers. Now, Baby Because wants me to pay the $24 to ship it back to them and $24 to ship a new one in ""Mahogany"". Not exactly the convenience I had hoped for!",0
I can't take my daughter anywhere without being stopped and asked about her pacifier clip. It is by far one of my favorite items for my daughter and is now my gift of choice for expecting friends.,1
"Let's get real here. Diapers stink. If you're looking for a product to cure that particular problem, your search should end here. Diaper Genie works.I have used both types of diaper pails, and Diaper Genie is the hands down winner. Sure it comes with a hefty instruction sheet, which I had to take out and refer to the first few times I emptied it. My husband has no idea how to empty it, (or maybe he's just playing me!) and yes, my mother in law has yet to figure it out. I also am not thrilled with the added expense of having to buy special liners. But in spite of this, I can't think of a better way to dispose of diapers.My son's room is pretty small, and you would never know there is a full pail in there. I only have to empty it every week or so, just cut the liner and pop out the sausages. (Or, &quot;stinky links&quot; as we're so fond of calling them) Buy it, use it, pass it along. Let's here it for clean air!",0
We used this cllp when we were in Disney and it was fantastic! It held so many bags on our double stroller and worked out perfectly!,1
"I heard so many great things about the Baby Bjorn and decided to try it out. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with it. Below are my pros and cons.Cons:- Huts your back after wearing it for more than 15 minutes. Weight is distributed on shoulders only. No waist strap.- Never felt like the baby was close to me, rather more like an additional appendage which got in the way of everything.- Hard to do chores with baby in the carrier.- After the first month my baby didn't like to be carried facing me. You can wear the baby facing out, but there is no support for the head.- Once baby's head didn't need the support and she could sit facing out it wasn't long before she outgrew the carrier.- Baby outgrew the carrier at 4 months (15 lbs & 26"").I also purchased the wind cover and had a hard time attaching it to the carrier. The carrier cover is to thick to attach to the carrier and still be able to buckle it. Had to hold it in order for it to stay on.Pros:- Nice design- Very easy on/off- Washable- Sturdy",0
"I'm happy with my purchase. It looks just like the picture and the material is nice (not to soft, but durable.) And is easy to place one handed on a shopping cart (the only drawback is it cannot be used for the restaurant high chairs, you have to buy their high chair cover if you want that.)",1
"White Large Letter Tiles.We play SCRABBLE no less than three games a day with our wonderfull friend Idah F Kerr whome will be 95 this year Lord willing.

"This is a pain. To use this for young children is just crazy. The strap to hold it on their lap must wrap around them and their car seat. Then, hope your child doesn't want it off until you are done with the car ride. They can't remove it themselves since the strap latch needs both hands and it is pretty much behind them! It also isn't as firm a surface and the edges are so misshapen from shipping that they don't stand upright. I wish I hadn't bought these. I'm hoping that saving them for later years will come to some use.",0
"I am truly and completely baffled. How this product has received so much praise is beyond me.I won't waste my time or yours. I'll say it bluntly and plainly: this product is a joke for the three reasons that follow.Reason # 1) This cotton cloth is several feet wide and a few long, and sells for $30 dollars. Seriously. You'll open the package and find an oddly contoured blanket that is, according to the product description on this site, and I quote, ""...made of the finest, softest, most durable cotton knit produced and designed to be washed over and over..."". Isn't that description just heavenly? Well, what you quickly realize when you open the package, however, is that it's just cotton. Nothing special. Just cotton. Selling for $30 dollars.Reason # 2) Take a close look at the lower half of the product in the picture... specifically where those adorable little legs and feet go... closer... closer... there! That's right, those little infant legs and feet are completely loose and free to kick up and down and all around. This is not good... not good at all. Legs that are kicking and thrashing keeps that adorable little angel nice and awake, providing that very special mommy/daddy bonding experience that can only occur at 3am. Mommy, daddy, buy the visine in bulk, because your bloodshot eyes, the following morning, are going to need it.Reason # 3) However tight I wrap my little angel with the heavenly stretchy cotton cloth, he manages to get lose. If he doesn't get lose, I wake the next morning to find his little arms pinned in a disturbing position that can't possibly be comfortable. I refuse, and will never, put him through that again.So there you have it, stated plain and to the point. I apologize for my unnecessary sarcasm. It's just that this miracle blanket is a miracle gimmick that is outrageously overpriced considering the material. I feel like a sucker for having thought there might be something special to this product given its name and the glowing reviews. I have since learned how to properly and easily swaddle my baby the good'ol fashion way: with an ordinary cotton blanket that cost a couple of bucks.",0
"It is supposed to reward with music but for the new at potty training every time you fidget just a little the music starts and by the time it finishes it only starts again, by the time something does happen the child is tired on the music and does not realize its a reward!! Also sudden loud sounds set it off, like the toilet seat falling. I was not impressed at all.",0
"Nipples last only month and half, but quality during that time is excellent. My baby accepted the product with no problem and lactancy wasn't affected.In fact, I'm buying 20 more replacement nipples to allow my baby to use this product for a long time enough.",1
"This car seat is falsely advertised as being able to hold a child up to 100 pounds, do not be deceived. It only holds a child up to 40 lbs. and Amazon has yet to change the wording on the description. The price IS too good to be true.",0
We bought these locks for our front and back doors. We have Schlage lever handles (like you get at Lowe's or Home Depot) and these did not fit the handles at all. Make sure you see what kind of handle you have prior to buying these.,0
"I bought the Prenatal Heart Listener Deluxe when I was about 4 months pregnant. I am now 8.5 months pregnant and I wish I had never bought it. It was a complete waste of money. I had read reviews on it some positive and some negative, but I thought I would try it anyways. It was a waste of money for me. I NEVER heard my baby's heart beat, all I do is rely on my doctors visits. I see her kicking all the time, but I never hear her kicking. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.The only good thing would be the microphone that is included so that you can talk to your baby, but you can pick that up a lot cheaper!",0
"I'm a Pampers fan! From Swaddlers to Cruisers to Baby Dry. But when my daughter moved up to size 5, the pamper leaks at night. She is a soaking mess in the morning. And the soaking is the particles in the diaper. The diaper literally falls apart. I bought one case and it's is almost finished thankfully. Back to Cruisers we go!",0
We just bought this monitor for our grand babies. We love it. It has great range and no static (as long as the monitor in the baby's room is on). You can really hear the slightest sounds. So we are very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!,1
"I got these for eating at restaurants with my twins. I loved that they had the little catch-cup to help keep food OFF my kids and they provided clean-by-my-standards surface for them to eat off of.However, I found that the suction cups do NOT stick if the table isn't either laminant or extremely laquered. If the table has any ""roughness"" at all...forget about these things sticking to it!Also while it's great that your child doesn't have to touch the nasty restaurant table...you have to either take the stains and crumbs with you or go rinse the thing in the bathroom! I have twins & I don't want to drag my babies to the bathroom in the restaurant to rinse them off before I leave. Even if you do rinse them...they're wet and drippy in your diaper bag unless you take the time to dry them. Too labor-intensive for me.It rolls up, which is great for portability. Now maybe I'm alone in this but I had what I call ""Mommy Brain"". As soon as I put the things in the diaper bag, I forgot about them. It was a week before I needed to use my diaper bag again...and discovered that I'd placed these placemats in there dirty...and they were nasty after a week to ferment.I've found it's just easier to use the stick-on disposible placemats.",0
"I purchased this for my son and we love it! It lights up his room well, and it's a perfect night light. The stars and constellations are clear, and my son loves that you can choose different colors. I love that it has an automatic shut off timer too. Very nice Night Light and a great deal on Amazon. Highly recommend this for any toddlers room.",1
"dont buy...i call this stroller the ""beast"" hard to turn. You have to take pieces apart to store it. I have a Ford expedition and it takes up the entire trunk space because it has to be placed in at an angle....i can not use my third row",0
"I just got this thing yesterday and used it today. Because of a review I read here I also got a foam insert. I ended up putting the insert halfway into the tub and leaning my son's head against the molded headrest and his behind against the insert and WOW!IT WAS SO EASY!!!!In the infant tub he was always listing sideways (he's 3.5 months old right now, technically too young for the snug-tub and he can't sit up by himself yet though he's great with support) and thanks to the contoured headrest in the snug-tub he did GREAT. He also had more water around him so he wasn't cold while I washed him like he was in his infant tub.He sat there and would not stop smiling at me! And my back didn't hurt from holding him constantly with both arms AND washing him at the same time, though I had to lean over the bathtub!I've decided to recommend this thing to EVERYONE I know who is having a baby!",1
I love these and they are very hard to find. Have contacted Johnson and Johnson but they were not helpful. The lavender ones are better but have been discontinued!!,0
"First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box. BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.",0
"This cream just doesn't stay on, which renders it useless as a barrier cream as far as I can tell. It's too creamy and wipes right off. My daughter got a very nasty diaper rash and I couldn't figure out why her rash wasn't improving despite medication. Thankfully, I ran out of Mustela and had to buy something quick at the local store. Once I switched to Desitin, improvement began immediately, and you can understand why. Desitin is 40% zinc oxide and very thick. It doesn't all rub off on the diaper the second you put it back on, unlike this stuff. As a new mom, I didn't know the difference, but now I do. I'm hopeful that this will help other new moms too.I just don't recommend this product if a rash has already developed. Perhaps as a preventative measure, it works fine.",0
"I registered for the Diaper Champ, but for some reason received not one but two Diaper Genies from well meaning friends. I had already purchased a Diaper Champ, so I guess I was spoiled with the ease. The diaper genie was just too complicated to set up and operate in the middle of the night with sleep deprivation and a brand new infant. We just put it (preassembled) into the nursery for our first attempt at sleeping in the crib and it was lousy. It just is not ""self-explanatory"" and as easy to use as the Diaper Champ. Even my parents-in-law couldn't get it to work right and just got the diaper stuck. I keep a changing table and diaper pail in our family living area and one upstairs in the for convience - let me tell you, that is great. Yes you can use the floor, but my back appreciates the table and it gives me a good place to neatly store supplies. I don't notice any odor from the diaper champ in the living area unless I'm standing directly over it or opening it to change it (and it currently holds diapers from a 6 month old starting solid food and a toddler). It gets full and changed approximately every other day. I returned both diaper genies and am happily using my very simple to operate diaper champ which uses any old bag you like. Maybe if I had studied the directions again with more patience, got everything set up in advance, and practiced during the daylight time, I'd have been happier with this contraption. Although I still would not be happy with the scented bags it uses - the only thing worse than a bad smell, is a good smell trying to cover a bad smell.",0
This nipple seemed too big for my daughter's mouth. She actually latched better without it even though I bought it in hopes that this would help her stay latched on. Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me but it seems to work for many other people so it's probably worth a try if you're having trouble with your newborn.,1
"I recieved this item as a babyshower gift. It was great for my newborn, but once she started wiggling and being more active (about 4 months) I stopped using this item immediately. This item is too upright and my baby fell off the sides. She was buckled in, however her head and torso where dangling off the sides. Obviously not making her happy! DO NOT TURN YOUR BACK!!!",0
"I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.",0
"we bought this topper to use when our daughter was 6months old. we were having her use the toilet to poop instead of her cloth diapers and the big potty was too big. i tried putting her on a small potty chair and she cried. so i bought this and it was the perfect combo. she could be up high and see us but it also gave her, and us, more security while she was up there. now that she's 16mos old, she still can't climb up alone to use it but can sit all by herself on it and it appears very comfy. it adjusts to any seat and there is no danger of it slipping off or into the toilet. once she can climb up to the seat by herself, it will be even better to have (i have vivid memories of being afraid of the ""big"" potty). i prefer when she uses this seat instead of her little potty chair because i have nothing to clean up afterwards! it's really well made - buy a step-stool to go along with it and you have a place to sit while helping your little one go!",1
"From our use, this product will work wonders for outdoor belly time. Very ease to use, and fold up after use, and the blanket is larger than you would expect from the size of it folded up. Thanks.",1
"I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail. My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort. Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough. I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn! I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us. I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing.",0
"1. Not wet enough. I've had to add water to every single package I've opened. I even store them upside down and it doesn't make a difference. They're almost dry to the point of being dried out.2. They smell terrible, despite being unscented. This is the second ""good for the earth"" wipe I've tried, and the second brand that had the same gross smell. TRU and Target brand unscented are truly scent-free. The smell of the unscented Seventh Generation stuff hurts my nose.I won't buy them again, and I'll be returning two of the three cases I purchased on Amazon.",0
"i contacted ababy before purchasing this item to find out more information about the mattress. i was concerned with the firmness of it. i was told that the mattress was firm and would not conform to my baby's shape. i was also told that it met all of these safety standards and passed numerous safety tests. i purchased it based on all of the great information but was extremely disappointed once the mattress arrived. it came folded in half in a box. no firm mattress would be able to fold in half. the mattress conformed to my baby's shape after setting him on it for only a few moments. this product is not safe. babies need a firm surface to sleep on, if not, their breathing can be compromised. after i original spoke to ababy i thought that it was strange that if their product went through all of this testing and meets safety standards then why didn't they list these credentials in the product description. they don't list them because it is not true. i should of listened to my instincts and never of purchased the mattress. i had a great deal of difficulty with the return but after several complaints they finally refunded my money. don't waste your time with this product. spend the extra money and get a quality mattress for the sake of your child.",0
"My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and she already loves this. I like all of the different textures and sounds from the mat and toys- the leaf on the bottom makes crinkly sounds, there are beads in a roller, and the mat itself has silky ribbon bows and other textures. My only complaint is that the two butterflies underneath the sound box don't spin on their own. But mostly she just likes looking at them right now, so it isn't a problem. It was easy to put together, and we've used it for a few minutes a day for a few weeks and the batteries are still going strong. I also like the music (it isn't tinny sounding like some) and the forest sounds make my daughter's eyes go big and round. I received this as a gift and in addition to her bouncer, this is her favorite item.",1
We used this when my son was 1 1/2. The seat would not stay put and he kept listing off to one side.,0
"First of all I want to say that I shop around A TON to make sure I am getting the most bang for my buck. I already had the Chicco Travel System and I love it, so I was hoping there would be a great Chicco umbrella stroller too. I looked at everything from the MacLaren to the Costco. This stroller is way better than any of the other umbrella strollers. Here are some of the reasons why I love it:It is the perfect height for both me (5'4) and my husband (6'1)It is sturdy (most umbrella strollers feel like they will bend and break easily)It has an AWESOME sun shade that actually has great coverageIt has a variety of colors. We got the orange and it's not an obnoxious orange it is a very nice deep red orange colorIt is only 11 lbsIt reclinesIt has a carrying case that is easy to transportIts big enough for our son that we can use it for years to come (max limit 37 lbs) but works great now (he is almost 8 months)I would highly recommend this stroller for anyone seeking a durable, modern, affordable umbrella stroller.",1
"I bought the pillow with some skepticism as this pillow is not sold in many maternity stores in SingaporeHowever after checking out the reviews on Amazon.com, I decided to try it.It was amazing that I can sleep in my 33rd week without much ado. The unique C shape propped up my neck and I could lie on both sides without problem. I would recommend getting this pillow in your 30th week so you could spend sleeping hours productively and wake up fresh for the day.",1
"I absolutely love all of Fischer Price Ocean Wonders products! Especially this swing! My son seemed to feel secure and comfortable at 3 days old, and now at 4 months, he is entertained and soothed by the mobile, motion and sound. I love that this swing is a cradle as well. The seat cushion is very comfortable, durable and easy to clean. My only complaint is that the tray has to be opened using two hands, and is very noisy when it snaps into place. When my son falls asleep in this swing and I want to move him to his bed, I find that unsnapping the tray to get him out startles him. Otherwise, this product is absolutely great, and I highly recommend it!",1
"Product was useless, came so small it neither sat on not stayed in ace while changing a baby's diaper. Not to mention a baby who is constantlyMoving, they should at a minimum be made in selected sizes so that one of the 5 fit.I would not recommend these to anyone, they did not even look like the picture,",0
"When I first got my Diaper Champ, I had problems similiar to other reviewers - the blue ring got stuck every time I flipped the lid over. I had to tuck the blue ring back into to it's slot to keep it from getting hung up as the mechanism swiveled around. It was very frustrating. I called the company I told them about my problem. I had no receipt because I got it for a shower present. They sent me a new replacement for the entire top of the Diaper Champ at no cost. Now it works perfectly. I gave the product four stars for the hassle of having a defective product initially. However, I was very pleased with the no questions asked customer service. I love that I can use shopping bags and don't have to buy special bags for it.Update on 11/27/2010I'm still using the same Diaper Champ and my son is now 2 1/2 years old. We also have a girl that is a little over one. Between the two of them, they produce some toxic diapers. We had a problem for a while with really bad odors coming from the pail. I was almost ready to retire the Diaper Champ. However, I started usingMunchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Packin the pail and the problem is completely solved. I tried straight up baking soda in the pail, but that didn't work. Not sure what is so magical about the Arm and Hammer discs. I use them in the kitchen garbage, too and it takes care of any funky odors there as well. I still highly recommend the Diaper Champ. What a great way to reuse all those Target bags.",0
"These bottles are wonderful. We have never had any problems with feeding, she drinks just fine. The newborn nipples were too slow for her, so we just got the next stage a little earlier. They are easy to clean.Only complaint I have is that traditional bottle warmers don't work well with these because the bottoms are removeable. It took so long to heat up one bottle that we just started making a new bottle almost every time, or sticking the bottle in a bowl of hot water.",1
"We bought this monitor because we liked the idea of visually monitoring our baby. Our daughter is not even 2 years old now and we are on our 3rd monitor. The first one broke a few months after we bought it (the audio monitor broke), so we returned it to the store for a replacement. Now that one has broken a little over a year later. This time the video monitor just stopped working. We called the company & they told us that the part we needed was on back order but they would send us a brand new set, still in the box, at no charge to us. We waited 3 three weeks for our replacement to arrive. Finally I called the company back and they said it had not shipped yet!!!!! They were having ""warehouse issues"". I was told they would ship one right out to us & in 24 hours they would call me back with a tracking # for Fed Ex. Received no call. Called them again. I finally got a tracking # & called Fed Ex. Isn't it funny that it shipped the very next day after I had called. Seems like their ""warehouse issues"" are just ""customer service"" issues. Not pleased at all. Save your money & buy a different brand.",0
"I bought this tub before reading reviews,and i regret it. the tub is actually 2 pieces that snap together, it is not easy to snap together. my baby is 6 months old. i tried to set him up in the little sitting tray, his little pee pee kept smushing up against the bar. not only that, but i wanted a tub that i can lay baby down in or recline. it is not easy to rinse a baby's hair when he is sitting straight up. but the way the sitting bar is positioned, if you try to rinse his hair, you cannot do it without getting water all over the place, because his back is against the edge of the bath tub. but the thing i really dont like is that since the tub is in 2 pieces that snap together, there is a big hard plastic thing in the middle. you cannot lay baby down (without the sling, which is just for little babies) i even tried to put those little foam things in there but there is still this big lump where baby's back would be. i will be returning this, i'm sure wal-mart will not be happy with me",0
"As most of the reviews here say, mine too had lots of statics and was noisy. For a little more money I bought a ""first years"" one and it was a world of difference.",1
"We use this as a night light in the baby's room. I use the green color option for when I breastfeed at night because it allows just enough light to see by but not enough to disturb or fully wake up the baby. I then change it to amber for when she goes back down to sleep after feeding because it is a softer, dimmer light. I like that it turns off automatically. It allows enough time to breastfeed and put her down before it goes out.As for finding constellations, not such a great product because you would have to have the turtle in the middle of the room a couple of feet from the ceiling. I don't know who has a room setup to allow for that, but we don't...just buy it for a different kind of night light.",1
"I bought two of these covers for my simmons contoured changing pad. They are not very soft and look like a cheap towel. Aside from the shrinking, both my green and blue cover have faded...even with dreft only washings! After five months of use I am now trying to find a better cover that will be softer, look better & hold up to washings!",0
"I highly recommend this product. I tried several other models and brands of color video baby monitors before this system and none were as reliable. I tried several others before this one because I was reluctant to purchase a 900mhz system when 2.4mhz were available however this model provides more consistent sound and video than the 2.4mhz models of other brands of video monitor systems that I tried. The color display works best in rooms that are well lit but overall the system provides very clear display in light and dark rooms. The rechargable built in battery lasts a long time and gives a warning that the battery is dying when the monitor starts to fade. Usually the monitor doesn't have any extra background noise and only occasionally has a blast of static. The microphone works well to pick up baby's breathing. I've had the product for several weeks now and have never had to enter the baby's room due to problems with the system. It is really easy to use in the middle of the night due to the large ""snooze"" type button on top which turns on the video. This is a great product.",1
I did a lot of research and this is best quality dresser available at this price. We purchased one in white 4 yrs ago and it still looks great (see photo). I purchased a second one in espresso this week for our second child's room (see photo). It isn't complicated to assemble but it does take time and patience. It took about 1 - 1 1/2 hrs to put together. The instructions are clear but keep in mind there are similar size pieces that are finished and unfinished in the illustrations and the finished stained pieces are in the front visible and the unstained panels are in the back. Initially the drawers seemed to get stuck when I added them but I just removed and repositioned them and they all open and close smoothly. Great dresser at this price point. Highly recommend.,1
"I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.",0
"After reading everyone's great reviews, I decided to register for this pump. I am sad to say that I could not get a drip out. The suction is very poor and I would have to imagine that it would take a good hour to get any amount of breastmilk to come out if it did work! I am very disappointed in a wasted gift. The only pump that does work is the Medela Pump In Style electric pump, which unfortunately is over $300.00.I would not recommend this pump.",0
Maybe the best $ deal I found so far. I would not be with out one of these. This one is very clear and loud. I would buy another any day.,1
"I purchased this mill with carrying case as a gift. It arrived late and the box was in poor condition because Baby Haven shippers stuffed it in a large manilla envelope to mail it. I requested to return it because it was not gift worthy, Baby Haven agreed and sent me a Return number on Jan 3. I mailed it back properly in a shipping box on Jan 9 with a delivery confirmation requested. It was delivered to Baby Haven on Jan. 11. I never received an acknowledgment or credit for my return. I will not purchase anything from Baby Haven again.",0
There is no record of a recall on this product on either the consumer products safety commission website or the manufacturer's website.,0
My baby had this since she was 6 months old and she is now 13-months-old. Until recently she liked to chew on everything she could get her hands on except this toy. She would always get bored of it within a minute or two.,0
"This product made warming bottles so much easier and faster! No more sitting in hot water or boiling on the stove. Drop the bottle in, 3-4 minutes later it's ready.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because if you leave the bottle in longer, the milk continues to heat even though the heating element is off. Anything over 5 minutes for a 4oz bottle and the milk is almost boiling. So don't drop it in and walk away!",1
"This Floppy Seat was a terrible waste of $$$$. It is very cumbersome to get on to the shopping cart & the very 1st time I washed it, it came apart. It is obviously made very cheaply & not worth the money.Take my advice & don't waste your time or $$$$!",0
"This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up. Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.",1
"I got these when I was pregnant with my son. I've given him this bottle a few times and every time the milk just dribbles down his chin. He definitely gets more on him than in him. Furthermore, the two-part nipple is difficult to clean, and the wide necked bottle doesn't fit my breast pump, so I have to use a conventional bottle and then pour it into the breastflow one. It's a lot of hassle so my son can cover himself in milk. I paid $14 for a set of three and they don't do me much good. In contrast, someone gave me some angled bottles from playtex and my son hasn't had any problems - no nipple confusion or anything - with them.It's kind of disappointing.",0
"I had high hopes for this food mill and researched it carefully before purchasing. However, it has far under performed relative to expectations. The mill is chintzy (predominantly plastic with a small, dull stainless steel bar that passes for the blade). The space where you would put the food is tiny (about 1/4 cup), it's difficult to attach the grinding apparatus to the bowl, it tips over easily and overall is messy. I can only use it to grind very soft items for my baby. I am very disappointed.",0
"I was looking around for the best feeding dish when this bowl/spoon caught my eye. I read the reviews and purchased it. It was the best bowl/spoon I have ever sat in front of a kiddo! Too bad I didn't discover it until my fourth child! Like other good reviews, the shape is excellent for cornering food, the sides are not too high to be a challenge getting the food up and out of the bowl. The chunky spoon is perfect and the rubber rim is perfect at giving the grip needed to offset the pressure the scooping of food makes to the edge of the bowl. My little guy was an independent eater at 1 1/2 half, I should add the he has Down Syndrome and found eating with this bowl a breeze! I would suggest that the first time you give it to your child you stand behind the highchair and guide the childs hand to the bowl, scoop and bring to his mouth. I did this demonstration twice and he took right off!! He does throw the bowl when the food is gone, and it has never broken in almost a year of use.",1
"We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes.",0
"We have tried several products for teething pain management and this, coupled with ibuprofen when it gets really bad, works the best for our baby. Our pediatrician cautioned us against topical numbing products because they can numb the throat and tongue and interfere with feedings, a problem we did encounter with oragel. This product is thicker than other brands which makes it easy to apply and it seems to stay in place well enough to spot treat certain areas without accidentally numbing the entire mouth. Our daughter doesn't mind the taste, although this was not a problem with oragel either. We typically put this on after bottles, just before she goes to bed, and it helps her relax so she falls asleep more easily than without it. Look for the multi-pack on amazon for a better deal than you'll find in stores.Life with a teething baby is so much nicer thanks to little teethers.",1
I am very pleased with my glider. Was just as advertised. Easy to assemble. Works smooth as silk...,1
it is too loose for the mattress. The water turns black on the washer.,0
The bottle warmer does not heat bottles evenly. The bottles are either too cold or too hot. The bottle warmer has to cool down before it can be used again. If it did not heat the bottle enough then you have to wait before heating it again. Save your money. It is faster to boil water and then set the bottle in the water to warm.,0
I purchased two of these (8 segments each) in an attempt to babyproof my kitchen and living room. I like that I can move them easily and reconfigure it in minutes. This is particularly useful when we have company and I need to designate a safe play area for all the children. It is also great to contain the mess!,1
"This ia a convenient way to wrap your baby so they can feel secure. Just as snug as they were in moms tummy. Yes you can use a blanket to swaddle them as well. But, this swaddle me blanket is very quick, easy and snug for your baby and puts them right to sleep.",1
"Initially we LOVED this chest. After about six months though, the drawers started getting stuck, coming off track, for no apparent reason. While we still use it after four years (because of the $$ we paid - can't afford to replace it), we have to repair it and fix the drawers about every 6 months or so, just to keep it usable. Otherwise they become jammed and you can't open them. Do NOT recommend.",0
"My son who is now six months really enjoys this. We needed to work on getting his legs stronger. This is really helping. He will jump in it five to ten minutes at a time. He also likes it when his big sister helps him jump or swings him a little. It is easy to use. He enjoys the toys, or you can change them out and use your own.",1
"I have purchased this, but I found the design of the unit is really unsatisfactory and it is not performing as intented. I have purchased aMunchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmerafter this and the latter is a huge improvement. The main problems of Prince Lionheart warmer are the following:- Wipes are not warm enough. Because of this, when you take the wipe from the warmer to the butt, the wipe has already cooled a lot, especially in cool weather, which really defeats the purpose of using the warmer.- Only top wipe is ""warm"". I open the top compartment to access the pop-up wipes, but in each session I usually need to use more than 1 wipe, and if I keep the top open, when I get to the 2nd and 3rd, they are cold already. (and I am talking about 10 to 15 seconds between each wipe). This is weird because the heating element is on the bottom of the unit, which should make the bottom wipes warmer, but not...- The ""ever-fresh"" system is a sponge ""pillow"", and it is a consumable. It needs replacement, which is an unexpected extra cost. they are 5 dollars each and needs replacement every 3 months, though I've seen people saying they needed to be replaced more frequently because they brown out prematurely. They will cost you at least 20 dollars for a year.- Electric plug on back of unit sticks out an inch. What a horrible design! You cannot put it flush against wall, which I suspect is what most people want to do with their wipes.I'm not saying the Munchkin warmer has no shortcomings, but it makes the wipes warmer (but not hot), and there is no replacement parts, and you can put it flush against anything. I am returning the Prince Lionheart.",0
I am going to be a first time mom. I have done tons of reseach trying to find the best products for my new baby. When I came across these bottles I thought that they were going to be the greatest system. Boy was I wrong. I was dissapointed that they cannot be boiled. When I started to take the actual vent apart I became so frustrated that my husband had to come help me. The vent is very hard to remove but even harder to replace. There is no way I will be in the kitchen trying to put these bottles together at 2 in the morning with a screaming child. I will be sticking to the traditional Evenflo or Gerber bottles.,0
"With amazon mom and coupons from my Parenting magazine, these diapers cost me $15! They are well worth the price, my little guy has a history of blowouts, and these diapers have captured them all! You do have to 'prepare' the diaper before you jump in, but that takes but a second. I never find those nasty gel beads on him in these, and everything stays neatly contained where before it would go up his back and out the leg holes. Some have complained about the size... they are all ONE size, a little bigger than a one, although they work just fine for my tall slender 2 month old. I am very happy and have just signed up for subscribe and save with these :)",1
"This product seems to fall down easily and is not comfortable for my kids. In fact, both children have tried it and can't make it work.",0
"We bought this potty for our son, while he was potty training. At first he didn't want to stand up, but once I got The Peter Potty, it's all he uses. It's very easy to use and it's his own potty! We did have some trouble with it not flushing, but figured out that I was screwing the lid on to tight. I would recommend this potty for any little boy. Remember to dump the tray every night too.",1
"We used to love this product too. But... wait! Things have changed!Before you buy it, I recommend you read the reviews on the new Diaper Dekor Plus ""biodegradable refill bags"". The Diaper Dekor Plus used to be a great product, then they discontinued the regular refills and replaced them with an alternative that is getting terrible reviews.The new bags do not contain odor like the originals, they are more expensive and they are packaged in such a way that the ""green benefit"" is completely offset by the extra cardboard packaging required to buy 6 refills.Don't get duped by the OLD reviews. This product has changed and not for the better.",0
"This is a great buy. Our son is a little over a month old and he has loved this thing from the beginning. The vibration is perfect and the heartbeat sound puts everyone to sleep, inlcuding my wife and I. We actually have a similar product from Graco, which is good, but the Boppy blows it away.",1
"I ordered this gate from BabyAge but they never processed my Amazon transaction. Amazon contacted them and so did I in an effort to complete the purchase. I only got a reply from BabyAge after I told Amazon and BabyAge to cancel my purchase since I no longer wanted to do business with them.If you want this product then I recommend purchasing through Amazon but not BabyAge.We finally got the gate from Buzmart, Inc. since BabyAge failed miserably in order processing and customer support.I'm unable to change my 1 star rating to 4 stars but this is a pretty good gate. You'll really need to try to find a wood stud to secure the gate. Sheet rock just doesn't take the abuse of adults climbing over (to prevent the kids from seeing how the gate opens) and kids hanging or leaning on the gate.The gate was easy to adjust and install. We had to take a panel out and that was relatively easy.",0
We received the product promptly. It was exactly as it looks in the pic. I thought it was of very good quality for the price. It hasn't faded or shrunk with washing which is one thing that concerned me because the colors are bright. I would recommend this product.,1
"I bought this seat for my 1 1/2 year old son. The seat constantly fell out. I called the company and they stated that I must not have the straps in correctly. I made sure that the straps were in correctly, but the seat still fell out. They are sending me a box so that I can return the seat to the store. I wish that I had read the reviews on this product before I bought it. Do not buy this seat!",0
Love Pampers from swaddlers to baby dry. We are on size 3 now and have been ordering through Amazon Mom Subscribe and save since baby was born.,1
"I ordered one of these for as a gift for my sister's newborn as a Christmas present. It arrived with pink ink stripes on the right side and none of the electronics worked. Amazon was nice and quick about issuing a replacement, but the 2nd one had the same pink stripes just on the left side and the electronics still didn't work. I will be returning the 2nd and will not purchase any Summer Infant products again. I was embarassed that I gave this as a newborn Christmas present. I noticed a week after I bought this that the price was reduced yet again.",0
"the size scale is very accurate but it didn't really help much for me, i had a lot more issues then uncomfortable heaviness.",0
"I purchased the Snoogle Deluxe in my 5th month and can't imagine sleeping without it. I am a back sleeper usually and this prevents me from rolling over in my sleep. It is also big enough without being too large or bulky. I am having a very positive experience and can't say enough good things, however...I am only 5 feet tall and I'm not sure the pillow would be so great for really tall people. Just something to consider.",1
"I originally found out about these bottles about 10 years ago from a woman I babysat for when I was 12 years old. I don't ever remember her complaining about them but in fact she seemed very happy with the Avent bottles. Now, 10 years later at 22 with my first baby, my husband and I decided we would try the Avent bottles with our son. My son has been formula fed from birth and when I shake his bottles in order to get the formula mixed well, formula leaks everywhere. In addition, formula will leak out of the sides of the nipple which will cause it to drip down each side of my sons face and wet on his clothes. Most of the times I will see it but there are those times where I don't catch it and I have to change what he is wearing. The only, and I repeat ONLY advantage I have found to these bottles is the flow from the nipple. The flow from the nipple seems to be much easier on him than the Playtex VentAire bottles are. I have tried the hard plastic Playtex VentAire bottles and he seems to have an extremely hard time getting anything to come out of those bottles. So, I definitely say do not waste your money. I am glad I decided to come look for other parents' reviews on these bottles because I was beginning to wonder what the heck I was doing wrong to make those bottles leak so bad. Now I know at least I'm not the only one who has had this leaking problem with them.",0
"I'm not a complainer, but this thing was really a piece of ... junk. It arrived damaged. Amazon wouldn't take it back but they gave me $40 off. It took my husband a looonngg time to assemble, and he's a whiz at stuff like that (Ikea furniture, etc.). I'm just disappointed every time I look at it - save yourself the $ and trouble and buy something else.",0
"bought this toy almost 3 months ago and my 9 month old still loves it....:) the various activity things are interesting for the infant and successfully keeps her glued to it but the moving this is not much of a fun thing as it has no brake system ,so for the ones who are just learning to take a step or two , its not so safe as it rolls forward faster when compared to their ability..but as a toy i feel its very entertaining.",1
"No more diaper stink! The Diaper Genie is a hands-down necessity if you're using disposables. Open the lid, insert dirty diaper into the scented plastic liner, twist the inner lid a few times and the Diaper Genie converts your stinky mess into a neat package - all rolled up like a string of sausages. When the Diaper Genie is full, you simply cut the liner (cutter included), tie a knot, close the lid, then remove the full &quot;sausage&quot; from the bottom. It takes more time to describe than to actually do it. Everyone I know who has a Diaper Genie absolutely loves it.One thing to watch out for - it seems like Playtex has a production/manufacturing problem, because about half of the people I know who have a DG have had to return one due to faulty cutters or other problems. ** If you get one that doesn't seem to work, take it back and get another one. It's worth the extra trip, honest.",1
"I purchased the buggy bag last month for travel with my techno xt. I used it for the first time to gate check the stroller on one roundtrip flight (no connections). After returning home, I was dismayed to discover that the bag had already worn through the bottom near the wheels and that there was a 3-inch hole in the bag. I love the durability of my stroller, and I am very disappointed that the bag did not meet those same standards. I expected that the Maclaren brand bag would be of better quality. I contacted Maclaren and asked them to replace the bag. They refused and said that the tear was caused by stress that was not ""normal usage.""UPDATE: Maclaren contacted me and offered to replace the bag as a goodwill gesture.",0
"Look for something else, this things are too small for my SUV so I installed them in my car, they'll come off very easily even without anyone touching them, they even can fall on your baby, stay away from this.",0
"I wish I read more reviews before buying these. The suction cups failed almost immediately. Unless you don't mind the prospect of duct-taping these to your windows, get something else!",0
"I have just purchased and assembled a black Stokke high chair. It looks quite elegant except that Stokke has slapped a large warning label (in 3 languages) on the back of the chair. They said that Stokke is now required to retain that large white label (not shown in any of the ad photos), and will not give instructions as to how to remove it. Can anyone help?",0
"I was very excited to find this product on the shelf. I love the idea of pulling out a second highchair but being able to store it away. The putting away task is a rather difficult chore, to say the least. The retractable straps stopped retracting correctly after the 4th or 5th use. All the folding mechanisms refuse to remain in a locked position, and the storage compartment on ours will not stay closed. I would not recommend this product if your child is more than a year and a half old . . . my 2 year old barely fits with the tray attached (does not offer adjustable positioning), it really works best as a booster seat at a table for us . . . Good luck using this product, I am glad to see it has worked out better for others.",0
I was satisfied with this order. My daughter had a heap of stuffed animals and they all fit in the hammock.,1
"I purchased this pump when it first came out. I used it to pump at work, while breastfeeding my child at home.I liked the features, the freezer bag and the arrangement of the pump and parts. While the pump was working, it worked well.The pump stopped working correctly after about 3 months of use. It only pumps now on the strongest setting, which I find quite painful to use on a regular basis.I will be replacing this pump with something else, now that my second child has been born.",0
"I was looking for a extra wide gate for my 85 pound 9 month puppy to keep him out of the kitchen when I stumbled on this. Its fabulous! I had purchased other wooden gates that he crashed right through with no problem. This gate is tension mounted so there are no screws, no holes in the walls and no hassles putting it up. I love the fact that it is adjustable so it fit my room opening of 60 inches. Its also a nice looking gate compared to the white plactic ones or the standard wooden gates. I give this gate 5 stars, I also give Amazon.com 5 stars for super super FAST delivery, low prices....and free shipping!",1
"The Mighty Tite, contrary to other posts, does not meet NHTSA crash standards because there are NO standards for these types of products. This after-market product is not needed to make a car seat tight. I've been a NHTSA child passenger safety technician for 4 years and have NEVER needed to use anything like this (I am an average size female with little upper-body strength.) There is potential for this product to come off of the seatbelt in a crash posing a serious projectile hazard to you and your child. Additionally, if it comes off, it will introduce A LOT of slack into the seatbelt system making the car seat incredibly loose in the crash and nullifying any &quot;protection&quot; you thought it was providing. Go to www.nhtsa.dot.gov to find a car seat technician near you for help installing your seat. If a technician tells you it's OK to use the Mighty Tite you should go to a different tech because the first one is giving you false and potentially unsafe information.",0
"My God I love this pillow! I didn't think that I would be able to sleep with a giant pillow like this but once I tried it, I couldn't give it up. It took my husband some haggling for me to stop using it after the baby was born! The only issue is that it would be very helpful if Babies R Us sold the pillow cases for it. Since it is all white, it shows dirt easily and it is hard getting the white case on and off.It is an awesome pillow though!",0
"Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.We are the fans of the AVENT bottles.",0
"My son is only beginning to potty train, but he instantly felt comfortable with this seat. I had purchased a construction truck potty for him because he likes that sort of thing, and he thought it was neat, but he hated to sit on that potty. I failed to realize how important comfort and feeling secure are in the potty training process. He was successful the first time he sat on this potty and tried to pee! Great product!",1
my little one loved them.. not expensive compare to others. contain whatever is needed for pretty long time and we have not had a single rash since we started using them,1
"We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately. She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it. The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me. This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now. It is easy to open, shut and lock. I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though. I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright. The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also.",1
This is such a nice way to be able to bath two kids at one time! My 7 month old son is able to sit up and play with his toys as I wash my 3 year old. The seat is much more comfortable and pivots easier than the one I owned when my 3 year old was little. I have even used it in the plastic swimming pool in the backyard.,1
"I've been searching for this product. I had this on my fridge for my first child and it worked great! It is easy to attach and it works well. My daughter cannot manipulate the latch to open it, and it has the option to disable the latch whenever you need to--like when company comes to visit. The only problem we have with it is forgetting to either tell visitors about it or disable it...we've ripped it right off 3 times (and consequently had to replace it). Adults seem to find it necessary to give a hefty yank on the door when it doesn't open with the first tug. I'd recommend this product to anyone. It works well on side-by-side refrigerators as well, though you need to buy 2 of them. GREAT PRODUCT!",0
These bottles leak everywhere. If you dont properly line up the ridges when you screw the nipple they will leak all over you and baby. Save your precious breastmilk and/or expensive formula and buy another brand. They stink!!!,0
"It has similar ingredients to Awakening Hands and is less expensive. However, it is not a moisturizer, it is very drying. It turned my hands white. I suppose it would make sense that this is a diaper cream when applied to a thoroughly cleansed diaper rash. It works good as a foot ointment.",1
"This pillow was recommended to me by a friend with the following precursor: ""Yeah it's an expensive pillow, but it's worth every penny!"" She was right. My sleep has improved tremendously since purchasing this pillow. I began to have trouble sleeping when I was six months pregnant, and am now eight months pregnant. There are many different positions you can use the pillow in to improve your level of sleep. You can even use it after giving birth for breastfeeding support.",1
"We bought this monitor because we needed another one for our second baby. It did NOT work at all. I thought that originally it was because the first monitor we had [also a Safety 1st brand] was interfering with the wavelengths and causing the static. Definitely NOT the case, I've tried it without the first monitor on and it's still filled with a ton of static. Yes, I've tried switching channels and checking to make sure they were on the same channel, and all that fancy stuff. [Our family is big a tech stuff, so BELIEVE ME, I've tried everything.] Nothing works, this monitor is pure trash. Try it if you want, you may be one of the lucky ones, but I prefer our more expensive one [in the $50 range], and plan on finding one similar to it [it's now considered an ""older"" model]. It really is CRYSTAL CLEAR, and works like a charm. [Plus the more expensive one has a nightlight option, controlled by touch, and it has two receivers. It's worth the money, THIS ONE IS NOT.]",0
"Plenty of space for my camera and a few other small items, and cupholders - exactly what the stroller needed! I was a bit worried because it was cloth, but it stays nice and taught so it is sturdy.",1
This is a very comfortable and convenient diaper bag. Works well for mom and dad! Lots of space and easily organizable! Comes with a changing pad cover too which is a must! Lots of hooks and pockets.,1
"Love this product. We live in the Northeast and with the weather so far, it's come in very handy. Don't remember the specifics of the outer fabric, but it seems to be water resistant and beads away the snow/rain. The only thing more I would have wanted would have been a flap or something to temporarily cover the opening if needed.",1
"I enjoyed this product. It made it easier to store and freeze my homemade baby food and milk. My only complaint is that i did not buy more. I bought a couple of products to see which i liked best, and i like this the best. Easy stacking, easy storing, and easy to pop out.",1
"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift before I had my second son in May, 2002. We had our baby girl in December, 2003, so two babies were then using that pail. It truly seals in odors, all with a regular garbage bag. (No pricy ""special"" bags to buy!) For two years, the room remained odor-free. Over recent months, we've started noticing an odor, but the pail has been doing twice the work for a year now! We used a different pail with our first son, and were not pleased with it. I have been truly thrilled with the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Diaper Champ -- so much so that I am buying a SECOND one today so we can retire the old one. I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.",1
"My son (8 months old) picked this cup over all the others I had and it was the only one that didn't leak if I let him have it in the car seat or playpen. BUT, that said, there is a little plastic cap that goes on the bottom of the spout and if you lose it the cup is then useless. I'm not sure if this is the reason that this cup leaked for others but I managed to lose two in the dishwasher and when I tried to go without it the cup leaked all over thanks to that little hole in the spout area. As for not getting anything out I have no answers - it's worked fine for us as long as I have all the parts put together right.",0
"Before I had my first, several people recommended this to me, but I didn't register for it because I thought it looked rather dorky. Like everyone else, I registered for a Boppy and got it at my shower. In the hospital, however, the lactation consultant let me use one and I immediately fell in love. While you are learning to breastfeed, you need as much support as possible so that you can use your hands. This pillow is wonderful! It does take a few seconds longer than the Boppy to put on. I usually just place my baby next to me for 5 seconds and snap it on. It was especially great because my newborn would take about an hour to eat each time the first few weeks and this kept me from having to support her that entire time. After the second month, I started using the Boppy more just because she eats much faster and it's easier to just put under her. However, I still often use the Brestfriend because it allows me to do other things with my hands while feeding her. If you can only get either this or the Boppy, go for this! It will make your breastfeeding experience SIGNIFICANTLY better. And, let's be honest, breastfeeding is hard enough at first that any support you can get is wonderful.",1
"I saw that I get to write a review for diapers and jumped on it.Everyone has a brand and opinion. Shy of using brown paper bag diapers or the organic cloth diapers (which actually harm the environment more than these diapers due to laundering), all diapers will serve their purpose. If they are cheap, you change them more frequently. The gal that said her child's clothes get soiled easily, might want to change them more often. We've had mishaps with even the best of diapers.Bottom line, whether its number one or two, Pampers Dry will do! Even better if you have Prime membership.",1
"We love our Radian carseat. We actually have 3 different carseats between all our cars, and the Radian is by far our favorite. It fits very nicely in our backseat, and we love how it folds flat for travel. We chose the Radian because it is taller than most carseats, and we have a very tall child. If she continues at the rate she is growing, she wouldn't fit into most carseats in a few years because she would go past the height recommendations. She will easily fit in her Radian until it's time to go into a booster. It sits her back far enough that she still has plently of room for her long legs while she is rear-facing. I highly recommend this product.",1
"I own a regular high chair and a space-saver, but I was traveling and so I had this delivered to where I was staying. It did the job, but there were two problems. The decorative cover only comes down half-way (as can be seen in the picture but I did not really think about the implications) so my son kept sliding. And the act of putting the tray on was very difficult and required a second set of hands every time it was attempted.",0
"This seemed like such a great idea when I first saw it. I had purchased a 4-in-1 tub that had a bath ring in the end, but the water was so shallow and my son couldn't really &quot;play&quot;. So, when I saw this I was really excited because I could just fill the tub and there was an armrest for me--perfect. When installed, it did sit just above the tub floor, but the armrest attached to the side of the tub kept it secure. But then I put my son in it. First, it was hard to get his legs in because he couldn't really bend his legs to get them into place. Then, when he WAS in it, he was smashed forward and his &quot;parts&quot; were pressed up against the hard molded plastic. &quot;OUCH!&quot; I kept struggling to keep him sitting back in the seat, but he just slipped forward and bobbed around with the water in the tub. So much for &quot;play time&quot;! Also, we like to use our jacuzzi tub for his baths sometimes, and this would not work in there since there is no edge to attach the armrest. So, we had to return it. We ended up taking baths with him or holding him in the shower. Now he is 8 months old and I just sit him in the tub with low water and wash him real quick. Too bad this didn't work as well as it looks.",0
"I've tried Holy Water and Paperback.First, the bad: while paperback was a perfectly lovely scent, it had nothing to do with paperbacks. Smelled, actually, pretty exactly like cookie dough or cake batter. Raw flour, vanila, sugar, eggs- the works. It's lovely but absolutely nothing like the cedar-dust-sweet ink smell of a book. I did give it a bit of time, and rhe sweetness faded a bit, but still not enough to call it bookish.Second, the really, really good: Holy Water is gorgeous. It took a bit to settle on, but when it did it smelled glorious on my skin and hair. Smelled like the best part of church as a kid, like beswax and incence. I think they did this one because they liked the smell but the Holy Smoke one had too much of a smoke overtone, so this might be HS without the smoke... Whatever, it's really, really nice.",0
"Let me start by saying my two year old is very curious and into everything. We took the knobs off of her closet door and put these on the top. It was a deterrent for a day. On day 2 she stuck her fingers under the door, pulled and this lock popped off the top of the door. It scratched the door up pretty good. She got in the closet within 5 minutes of her bed time. They do not slide well, they seem to get snagged between the door folds and rub off the finish. The second one shattered when she pulled on the door thus leaving sharp pieces of plastic for my 2 year old to play with. I ended up taking everything out of her ""locked closet"" that I did not want her to eat, rip, break, or ruin and left them unlocked.Pros: They are cheap and adjustable by simply turning the knob to tighten it to fit most bifold doors.",0
"Since these are used for only minutes and then tossed away , and never heatedto a dangerous level, the baby is safe and colic etc . is reduced. Only glass bottles are safer but they do not reduce colic..so I choose theseUsed them on 2 healthy kids and loved them",1
"Looked good in theory, but our 10 month old pulled this off the toilet in ~ 30 secs (& yes it was installed correctly)",1
"I love this portable changing pad! I get so finicky and weird about changing tables...I think they are gross! What I love most about this changing pad is that it is made out of some material that allows for it to be cleaned so easily. You just wipe it with a cloth, spray some Lysol and viola! you're ready to go, again.I do not choose to put my diapers and wipes in it. It doesn't fit well in the diaper bag that way. I prefer to keep my diapers and wipes out of it so I can arrange things a little better. I think that when the baby gets older, perhaps once she's reached a year, it will come in handy as I expect to be able to ditch the diaper bag but will still carry this with diapers and wipes folded up into it. It is good, and I will definitely keep it around for the next kiddo.",1
We bought this carrier after a few recommendations from friends that have used this item. I was also attracted to the many different positions for carrying the baby. After taking it home and trying this baby wrap we were quite disappointed. The material is so long that it has to drag on the floor in order to wrap it and of course it will get dirt on it from dragging on the floor which will be on the baby and yourself. Not to sterile. The carrier does not seem secure at all in any position. Not safe for the baby the product is to flimsy and can move and the baby can fall out. Get a regular carrier that works for you but make sure you try them on at the store to get a better idea of how it fits on your body and where babys head will end up being. Since a lot of the cariers do not accomodate shorter peolpe like myself of 5'3''.,0
"We used these cloth diapers as burp rags, as liners for car seats, as drool catchers when our babies were sleeping... they were wonderful! Soft, cushy, and absorbent, and they became softer with every wash! We use them now to dust with, to soak up spills, and to scrub stains... going on almost 10 years and still going strong.",1
"This gate broke about a month after we bought it - it no longer maintained the width you set it to. We called customer service and they informed us we that it was still under warranty, but we would have to break the handle off (a nightmare itself) and send it back at our expense.There are much better options.",0
Very pleased with the value and the overall appeal of the product. My 5 month old is not able to reach the floor yet to rotate around the center but it won't be long before she is able. I would recommend for any infant!,1
I bought this glider without trying it out or seeing it in a store first. Was a little concerned about fitment. I am 6ft tall and around 220. I knew me and my wife were going to be sitting in this glider a lot with the birth of our baby. It is very comfortable for those long sleepless nights and I am very happy with it. Very easy to assemble and a great price.,1
Pretty unsatisfactory product. Arrived very quickly. Doesn't heat a bottle any faster than running the bottle under hot running water. My nanny has simply refused to use it.,0
"This probably will be the only negative review I'm going to write regarding things we've gotten for our new baby. This diaper pail is a waste. I change it almost daily because the thing inside that is supposed to close after you put the diaper in remains open after there are about two diapers in the thing... this is not because the bag isn't in properly. As for ease of use, the thing with pushing the button in and pushing the flap back in order to get it to pop open... it's not terribly convenient with a baby in one arm and a poopy diaper in the other. The box boasts that the top (I'm guessing the little domed thing is supposed to do this) will push the diapers down through the thing and down in the bag with the other diapers... this should limit your contact with the diaper... however, this is not the case, and the stinky diaper opens the thing (which is probalby already open if there's a diaper in it.) and it's just... please don't be fooled by the low price of this pail. It's more a hassle than it's worth to save money. Buy a diaper pail by all means... just not the odor-less from safety 1st.",0
My 9 month old managed to start peeling up one corner within the first 24 hours. Probably would have worked better on a flat rather than rounded rail,0
"This product is not worth your money- it is flimsey and doesn't stick properly. Even following all of the directions closely, this just fell apart.",0
"After tons of research and test-driving this stroller in the store, I thought I'd found The Perfect Stroller. I was so excited to get it home and let my ten month old out for a ""test-drive"". I encountered problems immediately. First, the stroller was Extremely difficult to open and close. It was so stiff I found myself leaning on it with all my weight just to get it to open. Getting it to fold back up was no picnic either. I'd read other reviews about this stroller being ""stiff"" at first, so I figured it would get better. Three days later it still hadn't loosened up. I also found the recline on the seat mechanism to be very stiff and awkward. The final straw came when I noticed that I kept kicking the wheels every seventh or eighth step. I'm 5'4"" and don't have an unusual stride. It was annoying. I decided to return it while I still could (thankfully I purchased it at a local store that has a wonderful exchange policy!) I did like a few things: it seemed very comfortable for my son, and I appreciated that it felt sturdy, and it did have a nice basket. Perhaps I got a lemon, perhaps the folding mechanism would have loosened up over time, but I didn't feel like taking the chance and then finding that it didn't...",0
"1. These bottles are very easy to clean. I like how the bottom parts comes out, which makes your cleaning job easy.2. My baby does not have spit up or gas problem while using these bottles.3. No leakage problems4. No nipple confusion. Baby loves the wide nipple, and it was easy to transition from breastfed to bottle-fed.",1
I was hopeful about this product as I like other Avent products. It lacks an on/off switch which could be a potential danger. It also tends to overheat bottles. I took mine back and got a much less expensive model that works much better.,0

"I have used the Lansinoh, Medela and First Years bags to store my milk, and these bags leaked my milk twice (out of 5-6 bags we defrosted). We had no problems with the Medela or Lansinoh bags.In the past week alone, I have lost two bags worth of BM after three months storage. After close inspection of these bags, it was clear that in one case, there was a hole/rip in the bottom corner of the bag and in another, the ziploc portion did not seal properly. Both were handled carefully with minimal shaking, contained 180ml of milk, and had been in my freezer for three months.Given the difficulty of pumping BM, I strongly recommend AGAINST using First Years bags.",0
The is a great drying rack if you don't have a lot of counter space. It is much more than any other drying rack in the stores and it is more vertical that the picture shows. It is white and the bottle brush is the item that varies in color.,1
"my daughter slept with this for 4 months all the time then it suddenly started making weird noises like the batteries run out. we changed the batteries, but there weren't the cause of the problem.",0
"The best way I know to review this bottle warmer is by comparing it to the Three Bears. Using the same amount of water each and everytime with the bottle always the same temp before heating....sometimes the bottle comes out too hot, sometimes too cold, and sometimes just right. I plan to write the makers of the warmer and complain. I have been VERY unhappy with this product.",0
"I bought this based on reviews. When my milk did come in my baby was having trouble latching on so I attempted to pump using this product. The only thing it did was make me sore. As a result of not having an adequate pump to draw the milk out, my supply dried up. Had to purchase the Medela Pump In Style to help establish the supply again. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone!",0
"If you put bottles on this rack, they will eventually get dry... the key word here is ""eventually"". If you wash at night and need things to be dry in the morning, try something else. There just isn't enough air flow to get nipples, bottles, or breast pump accessories dry on the inside. We had no idea how bad it was until we tried another rack - the Boon Grass drying mat. It cut our evening washing time in half because we no longer needed to hand-dry everything we needed for the next morning. I think pretty much any rack would be a better choice than this one - look for more air flow under the items, or racks that hold items at an angle to let air in.",0
"I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat. We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle).Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways:1) The base is super easy to install. Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base. That's it. Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one.2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping). Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels.3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows. No such system on our old seat.4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right.5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt.6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room. Every inch helps.7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure and solid as the old one.All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one. Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly. The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design.Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price! Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :)",1
"I gave this product 5 stars because I love these products. I use this powder in my daughters shoes and it absorbs beautifuly and smells great. I originally bought this to use on my son's hiney, but his skin is to sensitive for it(darn it!) but since it is kind of spendy I wanted to make sure I could use it. My daughter likes how her shoes and feet smell now!",1
"These pull-ups work fine to absorb missed potty opportunities, but my daughter cannot feel the ""cool alert"" feature. When wet, the pull-up feels full & warm, just like a diaper. I really don't appreciate the use of licensed characters on training pants, and I will not promote the ""princess culture"" by giving my daughter these pull-ups with those *$%^@ ubiquitous Disney Princesses. We switched to the other brand.",0
"I was thinking about returning this but then I realized that I'd bought it too long ago to send it back. The wedge is two pieces of foam inside a cover--it comes with one half inside the cover and you have to put the other half in yourself. It's hard to get it exactly flush with the other half, which means that once it's in there you can feel that one half is higher than the other where they meet, right down the middle of the wedge, so I can't lay my baby down right in the middle. My other complaint is that my baby slides right off this thing and ends up sleeping at the bottom of the wedge, cross-ways in the crib. So he's not even using the wedge when he sleeps. I gave it two stars instead of 1 because when I swaddle him he can stay on it longer before sliding off. So far I don't think this thing was worth the money. I got this in case he spits up in his sleep, and because this thing doesn't work I would still be nervous about him sleeping on his back if I didn't have a motion sensor in his crib too. I'm hoping that once he gets a little bigger he'll be able to stay on it better somehow.",0
"We purchased this bed 2 months ago for our 18-month-old. He likes it! The natural color matches the rest of the furniture in his room, the bed is sturdy and of a very good quality.",1
"My husband and I purchased this tub-seat for our 6 month old son. We were very pleased with it, for many reasons: (1) it allowed us to bath our son without having to keep one hand on him - especially when Grandma came to visit(2) it allowed our son freedom to play and splash and enjoy his bath (3) having someplace to rest my arms was a nice bonus. We were completely satisfied with this product until we noticed black slimey particles floating in the tub. Upon inspection of the tub-seat - we noticed that they were coming from all the open crevaces underneath the seat that water can flow in and out of. A complete cleaning was performed, only for the problem to return a month later, this time 100% worse. In the underside of the band that goes around the child's waist region, water and moisture collects and does not go away. I could see the individual mold spores that are just about impossible to reach with any type of cleaning tool, except a really small toothbrush. I was in shock and immediately put the tub into a garbage bag and out to the trash. I don't think I know of any parent who has the time to completely clean this tub-set after each use, and nor should they have to. My now 1 yr. old son has been going through large amounts of allergy problems over the past 3 months - and will be undergoing allergy testing in the next few weeks - one for molds. And now that I know he was virtually sitting in a tub-seat filled with it, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the culprit to all of our problems. If the makers could find a way to manufacture this product as one solid unit, without open holes in the bottom, where nothing could get inside, I would be the first to change my mind about this product.",0
"Disappointing- not worth $40. Didn't realize it's just a long cloth you wrap around and around your torso that takes a long time to put on, esp while the baby is crying. I find I still need to use one hand to support my newborn's head, so it's not that helpful. However, it does do a good job of distributing baby's weight and minimizing backaches. I just got a baby sling (posh papoose) that's much more convenient- arrived in the box assembled and ready to go. Sorry to be critical but don't feel this product is worth your money- better spent with a Snugli or a sling.",0
"I got this tub at a shower and I wish I would have taken it out of the box earlier so that I could investigate it and return it. The tub is very hard to extend and put away. It is so hard to take down that I just leave mine out all the time. The seams in the tub make it hard to keep clean. I also have a problem with the seams leaking, even though I have the tub completely together.The reclining part of the tub is good and comfortable for the small baby, however it is not very secure on the top. Now that my girl is older and sitting up, I tried the ring and she hates it. The plastic has some hard edges and she got two scratches on her the first time I put her in it. My girl is a very active baby and I just did not feel that she was secure enough in this position. I have recently taken out the reclining part and an using it in our bath. She likes this better and is able to splash and play around.I would not buy this tub for anyone because it is very hard to use.",0
"For being AVENT - these are horrible bottles for the dollar amount. I agree with the other viewers about the leaking and too big of nipples. My daughter is six months and can not go to stage 2 nipples because it comes out to heavy. They are very bulky and hard for my daughter. My daughter took to the Gerber bottles &amp; pacifiers alot better. They are cheaper, smaller nipples and easier to load up in a bottle bag. I would not recommend AVENT bottles to anyone. Worst invenstment possible.",0
This monitor only gave us static. I guess if you live in an area that tends to get static on monitors. Avoid this one at all costs!,0
"I bought this for my first child 4 years ago when they first came out. I was a bit skeptical at first. I wasnt to sure if it was going to work. After his first night home we quickly realied that not only did it work like they said it would, we became much more relaxed and were able to enjoy him more with out the worry factor that every new parent goes though.I was never the kind of mother that got up in the middle of the night to lay my hand on his side to make sure he was still breathing. All I had to do was look at the monitor and see the green light flashing.The first night he decided to sleep through the night I didnt wake up the next morning in a panick like my other friends did. I knew he was safe.We used the same monitor for my second child a year and a half later. We had the same pleasant experience with the monitor for her aslo. I never had fits of panick that something was wrong with her. At leaste while she was asleep.Now i'm buying my second monitor for my next child due in a few weeks. I gave my old monitor to good will so another mother could use it.This is a definate must by for any mother no matter what number child your having!",1
"I bought this pump just to use at work. I wasn't going to use it that often, so I looked for a cheap inexpensive one. Well, that's what I got was ""cheap"". I hadn't even used it for a month and now it hardly suctions and the handle has become loose. It says that there is a 90 day limited warranty, but from what everyone has said about their customer service, they are rude. Why go through all the hassle. I had thought about calling, but decided not to. I know that I wasted $20 and I got what I paid for. Another bad thing is about this product is that you can't feed from the jars that come with it. You end up having to transfer the milk to a bottle anyway if you're going to feed instead of store that milk that day. I decided to get a Gerber Massaging Manual pump and it work a lot better and is more comfortable. Just like everyone else, I wished I had read the reviews before I bought this. It pays to spend a few more $$ in order to get a better product. Cheap is not always better.",0
"Upon receiving this organizer, I was first disappointed with the quality. The cover is a milky transparent plastic - similar to a tupperware container - more than a clear plastic which the pictures indicated it would be. I read the box instructions on cleaning - ""dishwasher safe, top drawer only."" Popped it in the dishwasher to clean, and when the cycle was complete I reassembled the box. The top cover was WARPED and now the box cannot seal properly, which is part of the reason why I bought this container. Seems to me like I have some pricey junk on my hands.",0
"definitely helped our 16 month old get better at scooping food out of the bowl with it reaching his mouth more successfully, great product.",1
"I purchased this product after reading a few reviews. It is a terrible pump. First off, I pumped every 3 hours for the first 3 weeks and my milk supply decreased! Fearing that I would not be able to regain my milk supply, I immediately rented a true hospital grade pump (Medela) which I think is the best around.Playtex cups are painful to use. They say it massages your breast, but try using anything made out of rubber and rub it against something else and you will see there is friction...Like rubber on the bottom of shoes keep you from slipping. I had a few open cuts from it!The pump is extremely loud! I called Playtex to ask them about it and the customer rep said that it is supposed to sound like that! I couldn't believe it! If you are trying to be discreet and considering using it at work or in the middle of the night, I would not recommend this pump. Again, the Medela Symphony is quieter on its strongest setting than the Playtex is on its weakest setting. It is loud enough that when watching t.v. I have to set the volume higher to hear it!The saddest thing about the purchase to me was that the company can make all the claims in the world and even if it isn't true, you CANNOT return any open items! I was extremely unhappy with the purchase and now am stuck with an expensive product that I will never use. The company made their money...I guess that's all that matters to them!I have a pump for sale...Any takers? Ha ha!",0
"Everyone else has said that their motor is VERY quiet, but mine is loud! The swing itself is beautiful! I wouldn't change anything about it except the noise of the motor! It is definitely a lifesaver!",1
"I haven't ever had any problems with leaks. These were the only bottles my son would take when we had to switch him from Breast to Bottle at six months old. (Milk allergies) The tri-cut nipple allowed him to pull the milk out at the rate he wanted (my milk flowed faster than the fasted regular nipple) while cutting back on problems with Gas. We tried the Avent system since I had the pump, but the bottles leaked. When you first open a new bottle, squeeze the nipple all around to make sure the hole opens, we had to do that with each new bottle before use. Otherwise, you can't get anything out. Since we had a six month old, we went straight to a stage two nipple. WE USED POWDERED FORMULA, so I am not understanding the problem with mixing. I poured the powder right into the bottle without any problems. Of course, the water in the bottle was already warmed to the correct temp, so the powder disolved easily. Cleaning was a hassle, but the time is worth it compared to having a screaming baby with a tummy ache.",1
"I had registered for the Avent bottles, not doing my homework beforehand. These bottles are horrible! The nipples are way too big for my daughter (she is 5 weeks) and the formula runs all down her face and neck. I thought maybe the nipples on the 4 oz. bottles were the wrong size? I went out and bought the 1+ month size nipples and tried them. No change. And although the nipples on these bottles are supposed to be &quot;slow flow&quot; I found that they really aren't. My daughter was spitting up too much because she was consuming the bottle too fast. I switched to the Evenflo bottles and they work a lot better!",0
I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very difficult to use. (until you get used to it) It didn't contain the smell well at all. The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to. The lid also kept coming off of mine. I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better.,0
I use this chair for kids who cannot yet set up by themselves. It works great. The tray is adjustable for many sizes of toddlers. They can eat or play while sitting up with the chair on the floor against the couch or wall or fastened to an adult chair. It easily folds up and I haven't had any problem with the cloth backing.,1
"Another reviewer gave it one star for the same reason I am. It is virtually impossible to tighten the LATCH system straps enough to prevent the car seat from moving about from side-to-side. It may be fine if you use the seat belts to secure it, but if the product includes the LATCH system it should work properly. The design of the tensioner buckle and the location make it nearly impossible to get it snug against the seat.Because it is so difficult to tighten properly it is not a safe product, as most people are likely not able to get it strapped in safely. Our Chicco car seat fastens super snug and would not lash about in an accident like this one is likely to do when using the LATCH system.Updated on June 9, 2009:We shopped for a new seat at Babies R Us and noticed that they have Eddie Bauer 3-in-1 models that appeared nearly identical, except that the belt tensioning buckle was a different design. The sticker on ours indicates it was made in May 2008 so it is not terribly old, but apparently Dorel Juvenile (who makes Eddie Bauer, Safety 1st, and Cosco car seats) changed the design. All of the models made by Dorel had improved belt tightening buckles on their LATCH straps.",0
I BOUGHT THID GATE THINKING IT WOULD BE NICE TO NOT HAVE TO STEP OVER ALL THE TIME. WELL INSTEAD YOU FALL THROUGH. AFTER ONLY A FEW HOURS OF IT BEING UP ME AND MY HUSBAND TRIPPED OVER THE BAR ACROSS THE BOTTOM SEVERAL TIMES THANKFULL WE DID NOT HAVE THE BABY IN OUR ARMS. IT DOES APPEAR TO BE BENT WHEN YOU OPEN IT BUT WHEN INSTALLED PROPERLY THAT GOES AWAY AND IT IS VERY STURDY. THE HANDLE TO OPEN THE GATE IS VERY HARD TO USE WITH EVEN 2 HANDS DO NOT RECOMEND THIS GATE FOR FREQUNTLY USED DOORWAYS.,0
"A good idea, but a bad product. The sound quality is horrible and the CD skips. It doesn't have an AC adaptor so be prepared to use lots of batteries! We removed ours right away and returned it to the store!",0
"This pillow works fabulously. I am 6 months pregnant and before this pillow, I had to use 4 -5 regular pillows to stay comfortable at night. Even then, I would wake up sore. Ever since I began using this pillow, I sleep very well through the night. Be aware, however, that the pillow is HUGE, and will take up a lot of room in a queen bed. My husband often sleeps in another room because the pillow takes up so much room on the bed. My advice: get this if you have a king-sized bed. With a queen, be prepared to take up 3/4 of the bed. Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers that your arm does tend to fall asleep when you place it under the pillow (it also falls asleep over the pillow, though). I think pins and needles are something pregnant women are more sensitive to anyway, so this may not be the fault of the pillow. Other than that, I find the pillow gives great support and really helps me sleep well. Again, other than the bulkiness, which is a necessary design element to provide the support, it is an amazing product!",1
"My daughter didn't like swinging so the swing got very little use. Even so, the motor stopped working after after 9 months. It would just make a clunking sound. Even when it did work, the buttons were flaky. I would have to push the buttons just right, too hard or too long and the swing would turn on and back off again. When it was running it made excessive noise.For $40 Greco sold me another motor section, but by the time it arrived, my daughter had outgrown the swing so I never used it! I put the swing in storage. Now I have another baby so I got the swing out and found it doesn't work. The motor makes the same clunking noise as the old broken one.",0
"Product seems to be designed well and pretty sturdy. I was very impress when first I opened the box and felt how heavy and solid each component was not like cheap Ikea particle board stuff.The installation went pretty smoothly almost to the end until I get to the part installing the metal lid hinge piece. After I screwed it on, I realized that the lit did not close all the way but stopped just about the half way instead. I took the piece off again and found out that the hinge's arm did not swing all the way like it was supposed to. I called the customer service, but only the answering machine picked up asking me to leave a message (lame). Instead of leaving a voicemail, I sent them an email asking them to send me the replacement.Then, I decided to look at the hinge in order to find out what was wrong. I disassembled it down to pieces and found out that shroud containing a spring inside was faulty and had a bump inside preventing the full movement of the hinge arm. I had to take out my Dremel and grind the bump to smooth it out. By the way, it was a pain to assemble the pieces back on, but I was able to get it done and fix the piece.Well, now the toy box is working fine, and it looks great and all, but I have to say that I am not very confident with the quality control implemented at KidKraft's product facility inThailand. They could have checked the hinge in a few second and rejected it...very simple. But obviously they did not...meaning that their quality control is not very good.",0
"I really like this pillow but trying to put it back into the case after washing the case is an absolute nightmare. I have not been able to fit it back in properly. I contacted the manufacturer to see if a replacement with a zipper or other design is available and was told ""sorry"" - nothing else for this model is available.",0
"I looked at several buggy covers in various price ranges. This one was definitely worth the extra money! It is so easy to put on. Unlike all the others, it zippers up simply for storage and comes with its own straps so you don't have to put those yucky store ones on your baby. The big fluffy pillow is perfect for those babies that are still wobbly but sitting up. The colors are bright and fun for baby to look at. All the extra compartments make this into a diaper bag if needed. I love how much cushion is all around. It really makes baby comfortable. So nice, even sleeping in it is easy. I've used it in a shopping cart and on a restaurant highchair and both went on with easy.",1
"When all I needed was the tubing for my PumpNStyle Medela, I was frustrated going to Babysrus and other stores because it was not sold separately. The tubing sold separately here is high quality, packaged securely, and perfect without having to buy the whole new $50 set from Medela.",1
"My son is 10 months now and this diaper pail has stunk since he was about 3 months old. The smell about kills you when you change it, and even when there's only 1 diaper in it, the smell is bad. Even spraying disinfectant doesn't mask the odors. I change the diaper pail way before it gets close to being full thinking that would help and it doesn't. I'm going to buy a Diaper Champ now...guess this just proves you get what you pay for.",0
"Overall this gate is very useful, and much better then the one I had before. With the old gate, I needed to climb over or remove it every time I wanted to pass through the doorway. This gate swings open both ways, and I can still close the bedroom door it is in front of as well. This gate also does its job keeping the dog where he needs to be.I do wish the handle were made of something sturdier than plastic, since I use it so often. I also wish that the handle was not an awkward safety handle- it's not as straight forward to open as ""one touch"" implies. Finally, it would be nice if the frame were completely made of wood for a nicer, uniform appearance- the surrounding part is metal and only the door part is wood. (and that handle is weird brown plastic)Overall, however, I am pleased with the gate and would recommend it.",1
"I was so excited when i found out that the camera arrived today. I use to have the saftey 1st monitor and it broke and was told this was a great one.

BAD MOVE. i turned it on and there was way too much static. when i flipped the channel, i saw my next-door neighbors son!!!!!!!! I have already unplugged it and it is going back tomorrow. Do NOT buy this camera!",0
"First out of the box, I was so impressed with the quality and look of this stroller. It was easy to put together and it is easy to use. I love that it is not much bigger than our single stroller...so much smaller than most other types of double strollers out there. I have a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn. My 2 1/2 year old loves to be up running around mostly and only sometimes wants to sit down while we are out and about, so this was the perfect solution. He also thinks it is fun that he has a ""special seat"" all for him and can also stand and ride. I also love the fact that I can use our bucket carrier for my infant until she can sit on her own.The stroller is very easy to fold up and so much lighter than other doubles I have looked at. One suggestion, make sure you purchase the parent organizer which doesn't come with this stroller (but should!).",1

My husband put the dresser together and had a lot of trouble because many of the screw holes were so bad the screws wouldn't hold. They were stripped before he even started. The outside pieces are pretty sturdy but the drawers are cheap and the tracks probably won't hold up for long or with much weight in them. This is a big disappointment. I want to return it but my husband said no since he was finally able to get it together. I wouldn't recommend this dresser to anyone.,0

"I have never written a review on here before, but after my experience with this potty, I thought I should. I bought it on here after reading great reviews about this training potty. I have to say, it gets the job done and it's small for traveling, but that's the only good thing about it. It's cheaply made, which is not great for my very active son who climbs on top of everything and throws everything where he can. Today, one of the handles broke off and anther broke in half, though it is still attached to the seat. It had a lot of nooks and cranies to clean, and I have had a few messes to clean up because of the urine guard as well. I have yet to use the portable seat on a real toilet so I cannot tell you my experience on that, but it is a hassle because it moves around a lot, as it does not attach to the training potty base.",0
"Where do I begin?-First the power adapter broke in the first several months of use. Not like I have time as a new mom to sit on the phone with customer service, so I've had to use batteries ever since.-Of course, I go through batteries like crazy because it takes OVER AN HOUR, sometimes an hour and a half to pump what I need from both sides.(usually 6-8oz)-The milk gets backed up into the tubes constantly. So, I have to stop my pumping session to clean the tubes out. At this very moment, my husband is dutifully cleaning it for me.-It's so loud that it's hard to hear over.-Overall, I'm in month 6 and have had a horrible time with the Medela Swing. I would not recommend this product ever. Even to my worst enemy.-I am a stay at home mom, so my pumping needs aren't even that huge, but this pump is ridiculous. I can't imagine a manual pump being any slower.",0

"I purchased this item for my two children about two years ago. Last night my 11 year old Alaskan Malamute suffocated to death while getting stuck in the opening. My dog, like many, had a penchant for dirty diapers, last night he knocked over the diaper champ, and knocked part of the top off. When he couldn't get to the diapers inside, he put his head into the opening (the top opening where the ball is), and got stuck. He eventually suffocated from the plastic bag. My husband and I replayed what happened with him, and discovered that a child could easily do the same thing going after a toy that fell in there, or just playing. If the child is monitored it would be easy to remove the bag, but the child would still have to have the ring removed (which took about an hour and half with a hack saw). If the product was 3/4"" wider in diameter, my dog's head would not have been stuck. My dog's head is about the size of my 4 1/2 year olds head. I would not recommend this product at all, and I am attempting to contact the company WRT this accident.",0
"I bought this jogger about 1 1/2 years ago. I have two children 11 months apart and I wanted something that didn't cost a lot that I could run/walk with and pull with my bike if I wanted. It is hard to run with since it does pull to the left. Ane yes, you do have to pop a wheelie when going around turns, but I just figured I'd build up muscles that way. My kids love the stroller and now they are 3 and 4 years old and just starting to outgrow it a little. The tires don't inflate well and there are big lumps in each one when fully inflated so the stroller doesn't roll smoothly. It takes a lot of time to put together. It is very sturdy but not compact. Unless you have a huge trunk in your car or a van or something like that, then it is pretty much impossible to take with you. I was not very happy with the trailer attachment. It didn't clamp down well on the bike so it came lose and was a pain to pull. It would slide down and as my pedal came up it would hit the attachment. I only pulled it 2 times. But in all, for the money...it works for me. I still use it now.",0

"I thought this seemed like a wonderful product but it's not practical if you have a crib that's not exactly like the standard prison bar type crib. Ours has a large panel on the back which makes it impossible to secure the back snap. Also, the snaps have become loose and can come undone very easily. My daughter is only 4 months old and she has started pulling on the sheet at night and it has come undone posing a serious suffocation risk. I am removing this sheet to never use again. It really is not that hard to change a normal sheet.",0
"I bought this bed rail (unfortunately, before reading the reviews here on Amazon) at a local discount store. I used it hesitantly one night. The next morning I tried to lower it to make the bed using the instructions provided and the bed rail broke beyond repair at the elbow, in the exact same place others at Amazon are reporting theirs have broken. This is an obvious defect. Additionally, the one night I did use it, I locked it into position several times (until the green lock symbol showed, as instructed) and this bed rail unlocked and popped up off the bed at least 5 times. It did this when my husband &quot;locked&quot; it, too. I did finally seem to get it to lock, but was worried about it all night, since it had unlocked so many times. If it breaks this easily and I can't be sure whether it is truly locked or not, I sure won't trust it to hold my kid safely in bed. I took that bad boy straight back to the store & got my money back.",0
We bought this valance to match the other items in the Turtle Bay collection for our son's nursery and this completes the look.,1
"At first I was thrilled with this pump. I'm a first time mom and I tried the Medella Swing and it stopped working after a few months. I decided to try out a manual pump and bought this one. I was very pleased because it actually worked better than the electric pump and just as well as the Medella hospital grade symphony. The problems started after a few pumps. I started to quickly notice that this pump was cheap and would break soon. It did- less than a month later! It just broke because of the cheap plastic it's made of. What a disappointment and waste of money! Also, like the other customer said, there are a lot of pieces to take a part in order to clean it properly and it is noisy. and- it does leak every time you unscrew- more waste of milk after you work so hard to pump it out!This is so disappointing especially since I'm a working mother and have to go out and buy another pump tonight for my daughter to feed tomorrow! Alhamdulilah!Pros: I love the bottles and liner though! They don't spill.",0
"I bought this swing so I could use it at work when I took my baby in with me. It's very portable and doesn't take up too much space. It was great at first, and there were no worries about the baby folding over like in some swings. Our son ended up being too heavy after a couple of months and his bottom would drag on the carpet and he would end up stopping himself. While he started off as a tiny little guy, once he started putting on the weight we could no longer use it. I also would have liked if it reclined a little more, perhaps this would have prevented his bumm from dragging so much.",0
I always read reviews and think that people are being over dramatic. But this product has really made me really take other peoples advice. This product is so hard to put together! The screws are too small for the holes required. The metal is cheap and the wood is as well. It took me two and a half hours to assemble!! My hands were hurting from forcing the screws into the holes! Don't buy unless you have time to get frustrated!,0
one word... ADORABLE!!! You can't go wrong in buying a blanket for annabell!!!,1
"My baby is now 8 months and the can has been helpful. I think it's great to make sure the really smelly ones are sealed, especially if I can't run to dump the trash outside. I do usually bag the really bad ones, so I don't dirty the the entry. It's also great now that the baby is crawling. She can easily knock over a trash can, but the Diaper Champ is much heavier and she hasn't been able to get into it. I doubt she will be able to get into it even when she is older.The bags are easily replaceable and affordable, far more than other options. My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled. My friends liked my choice.You do have to empty the Diaper Champ can and clean it, but since it holds some pretty toxic trash, I would recommend that with any disposal system. I'm extremely satisfied.",1
"These bags can easily hold 230ml, so you can collect your milk for several days and then freeze one bag instead of many little ones. Never had problems with the seal (as with Medela's bags - HORRIBLE bags!). Would highly recommend Gerber's bags to everyone!",1
"I bought this as a travel pump for a cruise I am going on so that I don't have to bring my huge electric double pump. Thankfully, I decided to try it out on an overnight wedding last weekend and after I put the bottle on the pump and tried to use it, the bottle would pop off every time I tried to depress the handle. Then I finally got my hand in a position to not put pressure on the bottle which is almost impossible because that is where the tork goes to offset the pump handle and the whole handle mechanism fell apart. I was so determined to make it work I fought with it for a good 30 minutes. I have no idea how this item could have actually gone into production because it doesn't work at all. This isn't even a matter of it being a bad item, it should actually be recalled because it doesn't even stay together much less work. I could use my hand and a ziplock with better results. =(",0
"My son LOVES this seat. We've been using it since we brought him home from the hospital and he's 3 months old now. At first, he just napped in it, but now that he's old enough to focus on things and try to grab them, he's mesmerized by the overhead mobile (he ""talks"" to it all the time) and loves trying to get a hold of the bee and panda rattles. The vibration feature is also very soothing. We also have the Fisher Price Aquarium Bouncer, which he also likes, but he'll only sit in it during quiet times... it's too boring when he's in his active mode.",1
"I had started with these bottles. Then I called AVENT, and they told me these bottles contain BPA. I switched to the Tempo Liner bottles and they work just as well.",1
This is one of the best things we have purchased for our son. He loves to play in it and it gives us a moment to relax. The only downside is it is a little hard to fold up but other than that it's great!,1
I have grandkids and dogs and this gate didn't last 6 months with them. The plastic stretched out and it wouldn't secure itself any more. I know you want to because it's inexpensive...but don't do it!,0
"The potty has a very small opening and my son was too big to sit comfortably on it by the time he was ready to use it. I have noticed that many of the postive reviewers mention they have a daughter. I think that many little girls potty train at a much earlier age than boys, and so the small size of the seat is not an issue for them. I would say that a child sized 18-24 months would fit comfortably on the seat...if your child is already a 2T or larger, you'll probably be better with another potty.",1
"My husband and I purchased the Bebe Sounds Prenatal Listener Deluxe Gift Set shortly after we found out we were having a baby. Following the directions, we didn't try to use the heart listener until we were well into the fifth month. At that time, we were unable to hear anything but the gurgling of my own stomach. We kept trying right on through to the end. Now, at 39 weeks and knowing precisely where the baby is resting, we are still unable to hear the baby's heartbeat with this device. My sister-in-law also bought the system and had similar difficulties. The only redeeming feature of this pack is the microphone with which you may read and speak to your baby, as well as play music, but this is something that can easily be achieved with a regular walkman or other such device, which most people already have. During this time when there are so many things to buy, save yourself the cash (and aggravation) and get something that you can really use!",0
I too thought that with 2.4GHz this would be a great monitor - WRONG! I cannot believe how much static you hear on the lowest volume! I thought maybe all monitors sounded like this until I started reading reviews. Do not waste your money!,0
"We bought this crib several months before our new baby was born, and didn't put a mattress in it until about a month after she was born. I wish we had done so sooner so that we would have seen the very serious problem with this crib in time to return it...When a standard-sized mattress is used in this crib, the gap between the sides and the mattress create a serious entrapment danger. I have researched, expecting this crib to have been recalled, but it does not seem to have been. The quality also isn't very good. The wood is very weak, especially in the small slats on the sides. I read that it takes a very long time, and many injuries/deaths for a crib to be recalled, so I suggest finding a different, safer crib.",0
"These wipes work great. They are thick and very soft with a wonderful fruity smell. The best part about them is that they are flushable. They never stopped up my toilet. Just flush one or two at a time, though, which is usually sufficient anyway. I submitted the picture of the wipes that I got from this Amazon order...so you can be sure that is what they look like. It comes in a big box with these dispensers in there (as noted on the item title). Great product and well worth the money.",1
"I would actually give this product no stars. I purchased two of these Munchkin products at a local Meijers store. Right when I put them on our van's windows they fell off. I called Munchkin's customer service and asked for a refund since the suction cups do not suction onto our windows, they told me they do not do refunds. I wrote them and told them this is unacceptable. The customer service lady wrote me back and said they could do an exchange for a comparably priced sunshade. Today I recieved my new sunshades from the company, which happen to be the same shades that I purchased previously and that I had said the suction cups DON'T WORK! I put them on my car anyways, and within a few minutes they both are on the floor of my van because the suctions don't work. DO NOT BUY THESE!!",0
"""This product cannot completely prevent pets from passing through."" This is not only my opinion, but a quote directly from the instruction manual. My 20# dog pushed it out of his way in a short time. It was mounted on a tile floor.I tried adjusting the length so the dog could not move it but as long as the dog had access to the sides, he could move it. The only way that I could contain my dog with this gate would be to anchor it to the woodwork.Amazon and the manufacturer need to make this (""This product cannot completely prevent pets from passing through"") known on the product description page BEFORE you order it.",0
"I work at a pediatricians office and had recieved some samples to hand out. Once the staff got a hold of these, they were gone in minutes. It smells so fresh, and leaves a soft touch and very light fragrance.",1
In London I use the Widgey pillow and so I thought this was similar. I went to visit my parents in the US and sent one of these to their house. It's not the same. It's too soft in the middle and my baby boy was struggling while nursing. It's not as solid and a great disappointment. My London pillow is amazing!,0
"We love the functionality we get with this monitor. I've read both good and bad reviews of this product. I was somewhat skeptical--however it works for us. We keep batteries in the child's unit and one parent unit, which allows us to take the parent unit with us outside. Keeping batteries in the unit also ensures that you have continuous coverage, even if you should lose electricity. On occasion, the receiver picks up little &quot;blips&quot; of static, but those seem to be environmental.",1
These bottles are terrible. They will leak. They will drip. They will drive you crazy.,0
"This is the third bouncer I have gotten for my daughter, the first two went right back to the store. I had an Eddie Bauer one which did nothing to entertain baby, it just looked pretty and then the Fisher Price Kick and Play which she hated, I think it was too loud and stimulating for her.She seems to enjoy the Magic Moments so much. It has two volume settings and the sounds and voices seem to be soothing to her and the lights are an added plus especially when she is in a playful mood. The three vibration settings are nice and the toys are low enough for her to reach even though she is only a little over two months old. She enjoys watching herself in the mirror and she actually fell asleep and slept long enough for me to clean my house!! I have never been able to leave her in any other bouncer for more then 15 or 20 minutes. I would highly recommend this bouncer over any other out there.",1
"I want to start off by mentioning I usually buy products that have several 5 star reviews and there is always someone who doesn't like an item, but I have to admit, this item is not worth the 5 stars.I bought a Summer Infant Bassinet from Amazon just a week prior and my parents were looking for a nicer bassinet for their home. I found this one and thought it was so pretty in the picture, however, good luck getting it to look like the picture in your home.The worst part about this item was the ""pre-drilled"" holes were nowhere close to where they needed to be. The directions were very limited and left you guessing. Lastly, this whole piece is very flimsy, we won't be keeping the canopy on for fear of it just falling over.I would not suggest this product because there are much higher quality bassinets on the market for a much better price.",0
"Again, my daughter enjoys picking up the toy and then trying to chew on the loops and does a pretty good job of it for a little while, but then loses interest in it. It's very durable and easy to clean. My child just doesn't play with it much and often loses interest after a few minutes. It's a good toy to have around to keep your child occupied for a few minutes at a time.",1
"I live in a trailer and we have super tiny rooms. This pail is a life saver. Since I'm a stay at home mom just about all the poops go in here but you can never tell there's a poop in the tiny room because it keeps the smell in so well! Just hold your breath when you go to throw another in and do it fast! When my husband takes the trash out at night he apologizes to me for having to deal with that smell. I let him think that I dealt with that smell all day but really my baby's room is always clean and fresh smelling! Just a tip: if you have small rooms or just don't want any bad smell in the room, take the pail else where or even outside to tie off the bag. The pail is super lightweight and the bags last a while!",1
"I purchased this and the Boppy Maternity Support Band at the same time - and I'm 31 weeks pregnant, with some ongoing feelings of thigh pain and belly pressure. For me, the mini cradle was ill-fitting, as many other reviewers have said. The largest hook-and-eye setting was just too large, and the medium setting was far too small. Additionally, the band was uncomfortable, and I was not able to find a position that worked for me.The Boppy band was much more supportive, and it's extra width helped lift my belly more evenly than the Mini Cradle, which put a lot of pressure on one area. I'm planning to return this product.",0
"We registered for thisw item so we could use it as a changer in our bedroom till Baby moves to the nursery. She absolutely loves the song playing mode, and will watch the dangling fishies contentedly while being changed or sponge bathed. My DH and I even managed a quick ""snuggle"" while she listened to the long-playing song mode. A great item--so far we love all of the Ocean Wonders line!",1
"I took forever to make this stroller decision. We had to upgrade after 7 months of happily using a frame stroller (Graco Snap and Go) with our car seat. I ended up selling our Zooper Swing stroller because it was heavy, impossible to fold, and had no basket access. So, this time I wanted something that was as easy as the frame stroller, but had all the amenities of a full-size stroller. I almost got the smaller Combi, but I didn't like the tiny basket and it seemed a bit small overall. The Torino is really light; it's folds up nicely and it's very compact, so it doesn't take up a lot of trunk space; it has a decent basket; cupholder for me and tray for my son; the sun shade is far superior to the smaller combi or most small strollers; footrest for smaller kids; reclines easily; adjustable handle; looks rather stylish. So, I'm really pleased with my decision and I barely miss our frame stroller.",0
"This sounds like a really great idea, but I've used it once and will never again. It doesn't quite fully cover the mattress and the edges curl up a little. That would be ok, but fussing with all the snaps is a pain and takes way too much time. I can take the mattress out of the crib and put a new mattress pad & sheet on in less time. I never really used bumpers w/my kids as they aren't considered safe once they can move, but when i did I found I only had to untie 2 sides of the crib and lift up the other to get the mattress out - so it was quick to do.I'm still giving it a couple stars because if you have a very heavy mattress you don't want to lift, or use bumpers for a long time this might be a worthwhile product for you.",0
"This bottle warmer is terrible. Here are just some of the reasons why:Bulky.Have to measure the amount of water. NOT something you want to do in the middle of the night.Will not defrost properly.Will not heat evenly.Will overheat. This is not a major issue for formula but a PROBLEM for breast milk.Cooler will not accommodate all bottles, couldn't use with Dr. Brown.This thing is junk. It's sitting in my closed and I can't even bring myself to donate it to the local Church, as I would hate for someone who's less fortunate to become even less fortunate.",0
"I had been searching for awhile for a Noah's Ark Baby Book for my 3rd daughter Alexia. I was so thrilled when I finally saw this one on-line. I have always been pleased with all my products bought on-line from Amazon.com, and this is no exception. I recieved it in only a few days flat. Their shipping is so fast, and I only paid regular shipping. Not only that, but I was well pleased with the product. The pages are sturdy, and filled with beautiful bright pastel colors to make note of so many special events in her life, covering 7 years time at that. The illustrations on the front and throughout the book are adorable, and the outer cover has got a soft cushion touch to it. It's so nice. I am very pleased, and I will be coming back for more baby items. =0)",1
"I bought this 4in1 bath station thinking that it would be very easy to use, but to my surprise everytime I put it in the changing table its water everwhere from the bathroom to the nursery. I would have given it a zero but the review points only starts from one. All you get for the price of the dish are LEAKS, LEAKS and endless LEAKS. When using it you need to have tonnes and tonnes of towels underneath it or on hand to help soak all the water that comes out when bathing the baby. The sling is aokay but you have to keep one hand on the baby because the baby will be sliding, and the sling does not stay in position. I would not recommend this product to anyone, because ITS A GOOD WASTE OF MONEY, TIME AND ENERGY! Maybe the manufacturer may need to read some of the customer's reviews so they can find a way to fix the LEAKING you get from the bath station.",0
I just got this delivered today and set it right up for my son..he is only going on 4 months and he loved it..i mean jumping up and down and playing with the toys and the sound of the music he went crazy..i would suggest this to anyone..it is great... ;),1
"This may have been a good product, but the boxes arrived destroyed. Absilutely not the carriers fault. Amazon did such bad packing, there was no way it could have survived the trip. And since the delivery box was destroyed, it would cost me more to pay the local pack and ship to return the damaged extension and wait for replacement. Instead, I went to the local PetSmart and bought this product off the shelf from them. Should have done that in the first place and saved myself the hassle. The Amazon extension is headed to the trash.",0
"We used the VentAire bottles with Baby #1 we had a wonderful experience. We used this Platex bottle for Baby #2 we did not have problems with gas, its just that we have had problems with the bottle.First, it seems that one out of 2 packs would have faulty nipples. Meaning, the nipples did not have a hole in the top for the milk to exit.Secondly, we have been using the bottle for 9 months and the bottles are starting to leak. Therefore, we are having to purchase new bottles.Yes, they prevent gas, but you pay for it over time with the faulty nipples and leaking bottles. My recommendation is keep your reciept and have lots of spare bottles on hand.",0
"I have a baby and a toddler in two bedrooms. I thought this sounded like a great idea. It is not. The monitor is extremely sensitive to interference through ANY electrical devices in your home. I practically unplugged my entire home trying to find what caused the interference, and never completely resolved the problems. Even with the volume very high, the sound was too faint (except for static). Also, I did not like the fact that the scan feature must scan all three monitors, you can't have it scan only two rooms. I returned it, and for a lot less money bought two separate monitors that work great with no interference or static.",0
When advertising a baby gate it is very important to have measurements available for the customers. I think it would benefit the company if this was available. I have decided not to by this and other gates from this page because of that reason only.,1
"This bottle rack only works well with 4oz. bottles. As soon as you switch to bigger ones, not only is there not enough room, the supports are not strong enough and the bottles fall all over the place.",0
"This potty has a seat that fits (poorly) into a molded frame. The pee cup is part of that frame, so you cannot remove it. The soft seat is too small within its cheap hard frame. This product is useless for older tots still wanting the reassurance of a seat that fits them better (on the big toilet), but needing independence in the bathroom. It slips around within the molded frame and within the actual toilet seat. The handles do not help at all, and the pee cup is really in the way for little girls. It allows no stability and therefore no freedom! I am junking it!",0
I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this mobile for the first couple months of her life. My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price. The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked (many arrived already cracked). The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly. And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well.,0
"The material is so itchy, rough and uncomfortable that I ended up tossing it to the floor each night. I bought it to help me sleep better during my pregnancy and ended up returing it. It is also huge and I found difficult to store when I wasn't using it. I gave it a week, even put a sheet over it to make it softer, but it didn't work.Save yourself the trouble, returning it was a nightmare, I'm still waiting for a proper refund.",0
My granddaughter loves this.She has so much fun in it and she learned very quickly at 6 months old how to manuever herself around it and likes all the objects but loves the piano section the best.,1
"I had no problems with the purchase from Amazon. The purchase was fine anddelivered in a very timely manner. The problem that I had was with Evenflo. I looked up what was supposed to be the base for a Carrier Carseat that was given to me and was led to believe that that was the base that fit the Carrier Carseat I have. I keyed in the product numbers along with the date on the carseat and was directed to that base. Unfortunately, that base did not fit the Carrier Carseat; come to find out the Carrier Carseat that I have is out of date. The carseats have a six year maximum lifetime on them and then are not safe to be used due to the sunlight damaging the materials the seat is made from. I am extremely upset over the fact that Evenflo led me to believe that this was the base that fit the item I had. Needless to say, I had to take the ttime to return the item and then locate another Carrier Carseat, stroller set. It would be much easier if Evenflo would post a notice that certain items are no longer available when you key in the model/serial number and dates on the tag.",0
"Don't buy this pump, I recently bought this pump and had absolutely no suction, it was a waste of money ($45), I would rather pay $20 more and go for the Medela electric pump for $65.",0
Save your eight dollars and just take off the knobs for a while. I store them in a locked cabinet and then when I cook I just put them back on then remove them when Im done. Then when your child is old enough just put them back on. I have found this to be the easiest method of protection concerning stoves.PS I also had the same problems as below thats how I came to this idea,1
"My 20 month old daughter is 24 pounds and this product appears to be too small. The side bands do not have the capability to fully ""touch"" from front to back so evertime she had a loose bowel movement... you guessed it. They leaked.They may be okay for children on the light end of the recommended weight scale, but they were not sufficient for my needs.",0
"My son is about 13 pounds, 8 weeks old and the straps are already too tight for him. We have to go buy another travel system because he does not fit in the car seat anymore. We are very disappointed considering these things are not cheap. Please check out the straps on the car seat before buying.",0
"We love buying diapers from Amazon. Subscribe and Save makes it so easy, I dont have to worry about running out of diapers. Plus the diapers are so much cheaper than in the store even using a coupon. We love the no fuss way it is delivered and comes quickly. Plus canceling or changing shipping/billing info.",1
This is the best swing out! This is truly a lifesaver. My daughter had colic and this is the only thing that would calm her down. It was great for long naps as well. If you are looking for a swing this is it. Great gift!,1
We've used the Cloud B Sleep Sheep since our baby was born. The product is well made and has lasted 7 months thus far on one set of batteries (used nightly). Initially we tried the white noise setting which worked well when he was just born. Most often we use the whale noises and he goes right to sleep (it's the same on both the Sleep Sheep and Sleep Sheep on the Go). The heartbeat setting was also good since it mimicked my heartbeat.,1
"The order came in a timely manner and the product wasjust what I had expected. After shopping around to look for theright bassinet for my new grandchild,the Eddie Bauer bassinetseemed the right choice because of its style and comfort.I also liked the fact that it was musical.",1
Comfy pillow! My daughter uses it every night. She really enjoys it. Would be nice to have a cover for it,1
"This swing is super cute! It swings in 3 different directions, has lights, music and a mobile. It has a buckle so you can buckle your baby in and a support pillow. Although the pillow was a little big for my newborn I still had to add my Kiddopotamus head and body support pillow. She loves sleeping in the swing more than her bassinet or crib. My only complaint is the motor makes a frog like sound when it moves, and after about 7 weeks now it's started to squeak a little bit.",1
"This toy can only be used with ABSOLUTE supervison. The activity bar continuously pops out. It will catapult many feet from the playmat if kicked just right. It has so far scared my 4 month-old, hit the dog, and knocked over many things. HOWEVER, my 4 month-old loves to bat the toys. I only recommend this item for babies who do not kick much.",0
i put it on like the instructions said and its broken after being on my fridge for one day was kinda a waist of money now i have to find a new kind to keep my 2 year old out of the fridge.,0
This tub leaks and I wish I had read the reviews on this website before I bought one. I have read and re-read the directions and the tub still leaks. Second of all the sling that is enclosed is highly overrated. My daughter slides down and it becomes extremely dangerous to hold a slippery body upright when wet. Thirdly the sling gets COLD and I mean freezing when wet. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...EVER.,0
"I got a green cup for my 3 year old daughter, i wanted a cup that isnt a sippy cup since i felt she was getting lil old for it and wanted a spill proof cup so i gave this one a try, it works really good and she is very happy with it.",1
"One more vote for this big, expensive swing's being worth every penny! We used a smaller, folding, more portable version of this swing before receiving the big one as a gift (from someone I'm now eternally grateful to!!!). This large model is infinitely better.For three months, the ONLY place our newborn would let us put her down while she was awake without crying was in this swing. Even when she was crying and fussing initially, a few seconds of looking at the spinning fish and gently flashing light under the liquid dome calmed her down so well it was a little spooky. Unlike most other swings, the ""seat"" in this one is shaped like an infant carseat, so when newborns fall asleep in it they won't slip sideways or loll their heads over too far. This baby-slumping bothered me so much with the portable model, I was afraid to let the baby sleep in it (which is half the point of a swing for newborns!), but the big swing supports little babies well. Getting this swing seemed like a life-changing experience to me at the time-- suddenly I could cook dinner or take a shower again without another adult in the house to hold the baby!The swing is also great for older babies, though no longer the panacea it once was for my now-8 month old. Some of her earliest sustained cooing and flirting was directed at the fish on the mobile, which she still loves to look at. The swinging still helps ease her into naps when she's fussy.The swing's sounds are surprisingly nice, and there's a good volume control. My husband and I actually enjoy the music (at least for a while), and the ""white noise"" settings are also good. We've been surprised at how long the batteries last (about 3 weeks with daily use at our house). The swing is fairly heavy and large, not what I'd call ""portable,"" but it's still easy to move around the house. The motor is quite audible, as others have mentioned, but once the seat has built up to swinging speed it's not an intrusive noise, more like a blowing fan.I can't say enough good things about this swing. This is one expensive baby item that's truly worth it!",1
"I use these diapers for my son...we have been alternating between Cruisers and Baby Dry. Now that he is walking, Baby Dry seem to be more comfortable for him, and they don't get as heavy as the cruisers. He sleeps good with these diapers, walks good, and they do a great job at keeping the moisture away from his skin. I'm all about these diapers right now.",1
"This car seat is not good for smart toddlers. My daughter just turned two and she has figured out how to loosen the harness and straps. The mechanism is very accessible to the seated child and there is no locking mechanism to prevent your child from basically getting out of the car seat. This is TERRIBLE!!! I have read many reviews before buying our britax marathon, and everyone seemed to like their seat and no one mentioned this important safety failure. i will have to let britax know, and this may result in a recall.",0
This toy is great for babies. My older son and I put pictures in it together so it made it a great family project. The book is very durable so when the little ones put it in there mouth it will hold up. My 4 month old loves to look at the pictures of his big brother and his big brother feels involved. Babies love to look at pictures of other children so it is great if you can put pictures of the kids in the book. For the money I think it is a worth while toy.,1
I purchased two of the 7 oz. Leak Proof Sippy Cups for my daughter. I have followed the directions exactly and cannot get it to close without leaking! My husband is an engineer and cannot get it to close properly either. The lid consists of 4 pieces and the spout part just does not seat into the lid portion easily or well. The valve also is two parts that need to click together in order to seal. I really have tried it over and over without success.I have four children and have used a multitude of sippy cups over the past 8 years: this one gets my vote for most complicated and least effective. I had such high hopes for it too! Wish I could return it after the money I dished out for two.,0
"It is a pretty mobile with lots of interesting things to look at for your baby, but after using it for last six months, I cannot recommend it.First, this mobile is LOUD. The motor is not too bad, but the turning mechanism is VERY loud with very annoying clicking sound. It also has small plastic parts that slide up and down as the mobile turns and it also makes a terrific racket. If you are looking for a mobile to entertain your baby, this is it. If you looking for this mobile to soothe your baby - you need to get something else.Second, it broke within 5 months. The arm part that connects the mobile to the base comes apart. Sometimes when you put it together, the connection does not get set and the mobile does not turn. We fudged with this thing for several months before it finally died on us - so no more turning. Very shoddy quality for something this expensive.",0
"Keeps wipes handy and much more comfortable for baby. We had an older version of the wipee-warmer with our older child. We have really loved this one. The wipes stay much fresher (no browning) and don't dry out. It is kind of a pain to wash/replace the pillows, but definitely worth the effort.",1
"Bought for us by my father in law. and i hate it. it's not a swing, not a bouncer, just a chair that vibrates. our son isn't even born yet and i don't want him in the chair. The toys that hang come off when you barely touch them and are heavy plastic. i also heard it's very dangerous and tips over. i hate this chair.",0
It is pretty straight forward. I only needed one tube but I only found them in pairs (which makes perfect sense).The are affordable and work perfectly.,1
"With my first child I used an Evenflo manual pump. It was very painful and didn't express too much milk. For my second child, I wanted to nurse longer and decided to purchase a top-of-the-line breastpump (medela). I have been very successful with this pump. The motor is loud if you are in a public place, but I pumped at home so the motor wasn't an issue. I would highly recommend this pump because the pump is comfortable, small enough to stick in a diaper bag, battery or adapter operated and gets the job done.",1
"I love the improvements made to this product. The stretchy tabs that are repositionable are a great improvement. I also like that the outside of the diaper seems to be softer, and less scratchy. They are very absorbant, and I have yet to have one leak. My only negative comment would be concerning the placement of the tabs. Before I place the new diaper under my baby, I reposition the tabs, so that they are close to the edge. If you don't do this, the tabs are under baby's back, and difficult to reach when the diaper is placed under the baby. But that is my only concern with this otherwise great product!",1
"I have twin boys (3 years old) and just purchased these for them for ""sleep overs"". They are well made, easy to set up and store anywhere! I did trim and use a foam mattress topper for added padding. The boys slept well and thought the cots were great!! Highly recommended.",1
"First, the templates did nothing for us- when put together as directed, it was completely misaligned.Second, my toddler was standing on it (briefly) and the plastic pieces completely broke in half with the screws still attached to the wall! It bounces and if you have a child that will stand on it, this gate is not for you.",0
"When this monitor arrived I was extremely happy with both the camera and the monitor. However I only used the monitor a few dozen times and the AC adapter (so we thought) failed. We purchased several adapters and still nothing. We now think that it has something to do with the connection inside the monitor. So basically we now have to use batteries. The batteries only last about one night, as you can tell we go through batteries like water....not good. I have emailed and called the company several times and I have not gotten a response. We paid well over what I would normally pay for a baby monitor. The total price including shipping was $177.95, I would expect the thing to work or at the very least I would expect the company to take responsibility and respond.",0
Pros:None except: function of first installed latch was so poor it was obvious they could not be used. This saved me the trouble of having to install / uninstall more than one latch.Cons:1) almost impossible to align; tip of latch changes locations as you tighten screws because soft plastic distorts. If tightened prior to plastic distortion then latch is loose / unsecured.2) latch is too short. My hands or medium sized and I cannot fit my fingers in between door and frame. I needed a tool to press down on latch.3) screws too short. They were sufficient length to install latch but not for catch. Catch had to installed upside down.,0
"The Sony is far superior. The only thing I liked better about the Fisher Price is that the lights are more sensitive on the F-P model. In every other aspect, the Sony rocks!The F-P picked up an AM radio station in my apt complex, along with a lot of static if not placed in exactly the right spot...",1
This works great for storing different brands of milk storage bags like Lansinoh and the First Years. You can even flip the cover over and use that to store the already frozen and flattened bags. It keeps the bags protected so they don't get banged up in the freezer and leak later.,1
"I wish I would've read the reviews before I purchased this. Our old diaper pail had pretty much given out..so I got this one..mostly because of the price..and I am totally dissatisfied. I don't know where they got&quot;odorless&quot; from...because this one is terrible. All diaper pails are going to accumulate odor, but this one smells all of the time. I wouldn't reccomend this one to anybody.Avoid!",0
"This car seat sounds pricy at first. In reality, it is'nt. It is designed to hold a kid upto 80 lbs with 5-point harness. No other car seat offers this kind of design and reliability. Upholstery and the ruggedness speaks for itself. This car seat will save you money because you don't have to buy a booster. It is worth your kid's safety to be in a 5-point harness system for as long as you can. I tried this product at Babies-R-Us before buying it. I made sure I knew how to install it and how to change the strap position. With a little bit of practice, a trained monkey can do it.I strongly recommend this car seat if you are a picky nervous-wreck parent like me. Nothing wrong with that. Check various stores in your neighborhood. I found a good deal at Target. Some stores have a close-out sale. Saves you atleast 50.00 bucks !I have rated this product 4 stars because the straps tend to twist but it is not a big deal once you get used to it. I am using it in a 2001 Toyota Sienna and it looks comfortable for my 18 month old daughter.I strongly recommend this car seat if you want your kid in a 5-point harness for as long as you can. No other car seat is close to comparison.",1
my baby likes these pampers. I tried huggies for different stages but it was horrible experience. woun't try anything else because it is just waist of money,0
"I have a few diaper bags because I get bored easily and like a change. Part of me would like another diaper bag now but I just can't find one that I love as much as the diaper dude. I love how the changing pad has it's own place inside. The cell phone pocket is super convenience since I usually combine my purse and diaper bag. The front pockets I use one for wipes (a full pack of wipes takes up a whole pocket for us), diapers (if we're using disposables) then teething tablets, small toys, my chapstick whatever in the other one. The inside has plenty of room for extra outfits, cloth diapers if we are using them, my wet bag and some snacks. One of my favorite parts though is the sunglasses slot on the back of the diaper bag. That way I don't lose them in the bag. They're protected and easily accessible.",1
"I registered for the Boppy because everyone said it was a ""Must Have"". I am breastfeeding my baby and I do not think it is a ""Must Have"" but it is nice to have - just not for breastfeeding.I tried using it for breastfeeding and found that there are other pillows out there that work better. The reasons are:1) It is designed to fit around your waist but it keeps sliping out on my lap.2) The top is curved and the baby can easily roll off the Boppy, especially as he gets bigger.I later purchased a Tresor breastfeeding pillow that was recommended by a lactation consultant and found it much more useful. It comes with a buckle that can be attached around your waist so it stays put on your lap. Also it is much larger and flat accros the top. I do not feel like the baby is going to roll off the pillow, which is nice when you are trying to undo a nursing bra or grab a burp cloth.I do love the Boppy for other reasons. I have used it as a ""nest"" for my napping baby. He is now 8 weeks old and frequently I put him in the Boppy to curl up while I am doing other things. He seems really comfortable and stays put. I'm sure as he gets older we will use it more for sitting up and tummy time.The fleece cover is nice and seems to stay clean. It has washed well a couple of times. However the extra covers that we purchased came apart in the laundry.I recommend getting the Boppy for other reasons than for breastfeeding.",1
"These bottles have been used in the UK for years. I bought one and my husband made the passing remark, Oh, everyone uses these back home (him being British). When shopping for bottles while I was pregnant, we'd bought the Newborn set of Playtex drop-ins, a gift-set of the Ventaires and it wasn't until my son was about 2 weeks old that I bought one of these.My son is now 11 weeks old and I can honestly say that I only use this bottle as a last resort. My husband and I, both have had problems with leaks, though not terribly so. It isn't due to the lack of following instructions, either. As I said, these are the most common ones my husband has used in England and he's very familiar with them.The main reason I don't like these bottles is that the vents are on the nipple ring, allowing the air to pass through and aerate the formula, contributing to gas, which is thought to be the main cause of colic. The slower flow nipple is still too fast for my baby, even with him being a big eater. He has trouble controlling the flow on this bottle, that's where he gets messy, stuggles to feed, gets frustrated and then refuses the bottle. The ventaire bottles allow the natural vacuum in the bottle to suck air in through the bottle of the bottle via a thin silicone membrane on the vent rings. No air enters the formula and bubbles stay far away from baby's tummy.Like others, I too, have found that the nipple isn't helpful to a breast/bottle fed baby. The shape looks like it would be helpful with latch as the pacakge suggests, but, really, any wide neck bottle provides a bit of latch help just as much. The silicone on these is just too thick and firm.If you do want to try these bottles, I suggest putting in an anti-gas agent, like simethicone (Mylicon, I use the Wal-mart brand... much more affordable), into the formula before shaking. This will greatly reduce the retention of bubbles in the bottle, and burp your baby well. I also suggest getting the nipple slower than what the package suggests.Just remember, bubbles going through the formula means bubbles in the tummy, and bubbles in the tummy means gas and discomfort.",0
"I purchased this monitor about a year and a half ago and within the first couple of months one of the dual monitors just stopped working. Aside from that, the monitor itself is very loud and fuzzy at ALL times and no matter what channel it is on, it frequently makes a beeping sound. Now just a year and a half after using it..the other monitor has stopped working. This monitor is such poor quality. Do not waste your money on this monitor, let alone any fisher price monitor.",0
"I had my carseat checked today and the cps techs said that this is a bad device and can crack and hurt babies, ruin your car belts, ect.. PLEASE DO NOT USE!!! i USED THIS FOR 8 MONTHS, YES IT WORKED WONDERFULLY, BUT IS DANGEROUS....NEVER WOULD OF FORGIVEN MYSELF IF HURT MY CHILD. I GAVE IT TO THEM TO USE AS AN EXAMPLE. THEY GOT MY CARSEAT IN SO TIGHT WITHOUT THE USE OF THIS MIGHTY TIGHT. tHIS ITEM SHOULD BE RECALLED. :-(",0
"I can't even use this bottles yet because they arrived with FAST flow nipples, although the picture clearly shows a box with SLOW flow ones! Annoying, inconvenient, and a hassle. Thanks amazon. Urgh.",0
"Can't beat these prices and door-to-door delivery. If you combine subscribe and save deals with Amazon coupon sales, you get free shipping and the box of diapers typically comes in 48 hours in my experience. Diaper shopping made easy and cheap!",1
I'm very unhappy and disappointed with these bottles. besides the bottles leaking between the bottle and the ring the flow is too fast for a newborn. i also bought the starter set that comes with newborn nipples and still the flow is way too fast for my 1 week old daughter. when i feed her the formula comes out so fast she just ends up spitting most of out and then she chokes. i didn't want to give up on these bottles so fast especially because i bought 9 of them! so i went to the store to see if i can find &quot;real&quot; newborn nipples. Well the ones that I did find which are the ones that came with the set are for babies 3+ months. Not helpful to me right now. So I just basically wasted a lot of money on these bottles. We'll see how the disposable Avent bottles work. Right now I switched to the Playtex disposable bottles and DO NOT have a problem at all with these. this is my 3rd child so i've tried a lot of different bottles and always seem to go back to the disposables. Also the Playtex Vent Aire bottles are really good too.i read the review from &quot;claire's mom&quot; on how to stop the bottles from leaking which i have to admit did help but because they are that complicated i don't like them not to mention the fact the nipple flow is not for a newborn.,0
"As a first-time parent I am very concerned about SIDS. This product looked great for me and my baby. When I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital, I was reluctant to let her sleep in her crib in the nursery. (My bedroom is on the other side of the house). But my husband finally convinced me once the Angel Care Sound & Movement Monitor was in place. After I had finally dozed off to sleep, the alarm sounded and I immediately jumped out of bed and ran to the baby's room. (And busted several episotomy stitches in the process). False alarm. After 5 (FIVE) false alarms and several adjustments, I threw it into the trash. The worst part of the entire situation (besides the price tag) was that I actually thought that my daughter might not be breathing. I lost many, many nights sleep due to the malfunction of this product. Even the sound monitor is horrible and I don't use that, either. I ended up buying a FISHER-PRICE sound monitor for less than half the cost of the Angel Care. The reception is so much better! Works well for naps but as for sleeping through the night - my daughter now sleeps beside me. That is my peace of mind.",0
We have this carrier and I like it for short trips to the store. But I won't use it for any extended length of time. The position of the straps for the face in feature made it hard for my son to get comfortable while sleeping it always left red marks on the side of his head unless I loosened the strap and padded it with a blanket or cloth diaper. Then I was afraid to take my hands off of him for fear he would fall. For the face out feature it is very hard to get your child into the carrier with the way that the head rest slides down so the baby can see out. It is awkward to have to hold it down while trying to maneuver the baby into the carrier. My son is a big boy at 16 pounds and 26 inches long and is only 5 month old but is well with in the recommended weight and height limits. So this should not be a struggle to get him in and out of. It is also very hard to adjust from one person to the next you have to fiddle with it before you put the baby in and then hope it fits both of you comfortably. I am sure that there are better carriers out there for a reasonable price.,0
The first thing I noticed is that my babies name was smudged before I even opened it. When I opened it the two crowns at the top fell apart! The ribbon is also shorter then I thought it would be.,0
"This product works ok. However, the refills are EXPENSIVE!!! I finally gave up using the thing because of the money I was spending on the refills. It's much cheaper just to throw the diaper away tied up in a supermarket bag. We're now expecting our second child, and I'm considering the diaper champ, because it uses regular bags. If I had to do it again, I never would have gotten this.",0
Our little guy likes his changing pad! It's pretty comfortable for him and for us. It's easy to clean without the cover that we bought separately.,1
"Please anyone reading the reviews, DO NOT BUY THESE. I bought them being a first timer and they are a pain in the butt. The nipples are not good. Stage 1 dont give enuf and stage 2 give too much. The first night my son was home we had to go and get all new nipples after we had bought about 50 of the ventaire ones. They do not even do what they promise, the bubbles stay in the bottles and my lil guy spits up and burps a whole lot and has many nights where hes cranky because of gas. And the washing of them is also a pain. you hafta take them apart every time to get all of the milk off of them. and when you dont have a lot of time to do much, these are not right. For every one out there, please do not get there. if you do your in for a ride.",0
I don't know about those two rave reviews - do NOT expect anything magical to happen with this cream. At least that's been my experience. It's nothing special for the price.,0
"Compared to other stores it costs less when we buy on amazon prime .I enjoy shopping in amazon.com.Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Size 4, 140 Count",1
I do not like these bags. The twist tie closure system is cumbersome. The bags are small. The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen. The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.,0
my grandaughter loves them. they keep her entertained and are great for starting her on coordination and learning different colors. Good educational product. Thank you!,1
"My son (3.5 months) wiggles around so much I'm afraid the sling is going to shoot right out from under him. He pushes his heels into the bottom of the tub and pushes backwards. This tub might be alright for an older baby, but if you have a wild one like mine, then you might want to pass.",0
I ordered this glider before my son was born because it was inexpensive and had good reviews. It is nice looking chair but not very comfortable. The material seems cheap and the bottom cushion lost its shape very quickly. It is also uncomfortable to sit in for a long period of time and I had a hard time sleeping in it. My biggest complaint is that the spring in the chair broke three times. I am petite and not much weight was put on it. We ended up returning it and getting our money back.,0
"The Floppy seat is just remarkable ! WE LOVE IT ! It is very convenient to use and is machine washable. Unlike a stroller , the child can face you and not feel left out. My 11 month old son, Loves being in the Floppy seat, he likes the cushiony feel and I feel secure, as the strap of the seat goes from around the shopping cart grids and tightly secures his waist to restrict him from climbing on top of the cart. I can now go shopping alone and not have to worry about pushing a stroller and a shopping cart side-by-side.This is a Great Gift and its worth every penny you spend on it. Your answer to ""A Germ free ! Care free !"" trips to the Supermarkets and the resturants .",1
"I have twins who were born early and tiny. The sling didn't even work for them bc even when as tight as possible, the bump under them hit their back. I'm one to ""make do"" so every bath I put a hand towel on it to cushion it at least. I just knew it would get better in the next stage. WRONG!! The next stage where their bottom is supported by the bump is horrible bc the bump is too close and my babies were sitting up against the plastic at a dangerous and wobbly angle. I was so affraid they would flop over that I went out the next day and bought a new one. I am so dissappointed in this product bc I love the brand. I cannot even fathom how people give this five stars or even use it at all!!",0
I had tried other disposable training pants and these were by far the best when it came to not leaking. I will continue to buy these over the others out there!,1
"As a new mom with a VERY heavy milk flow, I have tried several different breast pads over the last few months. Here is my overview of each:Johnsons baby nursing pads - 60 Ea: These are my FAVORITE pads for daytime use. They will not hold as much as Ameda, so they aren't as reliable overnight. However, they are very soft and comfortable against tender breasts, They also have a nice shape that is more discrete than other brands. I also love that they are not packed in pairs or singles, just all lumped in the box together. Yes, this means they are not as ""sterile"" as the other brands, but they aren't a haste to unpack each time you need a fresh pad, and you don't risk waking up baby with crinkly wrappers. They do have an adhesive to keep them secure in your bra. Also, they are the only pad I know of with a nipple indentation, meaning they are a little less abusive to already sore nipples.Ameda 50 Count Noshow Premium Disposable Nursing Pads: These are the most absorbent pads I have found. In fact, they are the only ones that keep me dry overnight. However, they have no shape to them at all, and are extremely obvious if you wear a thin bra. They have no adhesive, so they will move around in your bra. Also, they are packaged in an extremely crinkly wrapper, so if my baby is asleep I have to take them in another room to open, so as not to wake up the baby (and he is a heavy sleeper!)The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct.: These are the best pads for early stages of nursing, when the lanolin will help soothe sore and cracked nipples. They are very cool and comfortable on your nipples. However, they do not hold quite as much as the Ameda. I did find that these needed to be changed pretty often to avoid feeling damp. Also, the edges of the pad are scratchy and can be a bit uncomfortable throughout the day.Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-pack: These are a good all-around pad. They will hold a good bit, but not as much as the Ameda or J&J.; They do have an adhesive strip that will help them stay in place in your bra, and are a very good value to use long term. Be sure you get the ""soft"" version, as the older style is much more scratchy and uncomfortable.Evenflo Comfort Select Nursing Pad, 48 Count: These pads are very absorbent, but not very comfortable. They have an itchy material inside that tends to stick to cracked nipples when removed. They also are very obvious through thin bras.Gerber Breast Pads - Variety Pack 100 Count: WORTHLESS. These pads do not absorb even a single let-down if you have a heavy flow. They would instantly soak through and my shirt would be wet. Also, they have no shape so they will bunch up and show through your bra and shirt. They also have no adhesive, so they will move around. Overall, completely worthless for a heavy milk flow.",1
I found this item here on Amazon.com and after reading several reviews decided to try it! WOW!! What a wonderful product! You can use it with your newborn up to your toddler! I still use it with my 16 mo old. He loves it because it is soft and keeps his ears and head out of the water while still allowing you to easily bath them! It is also very easy to clean...just throw it in the washer with a little color safe bleach and hang to dry! I definately recommend this product by LEACHCO and have sent it as shower gifts repeatedly!,1
I bought this cream for my 6 months old baby and after using it for a couple of days I couldn't stand the smell of it. This cream has an extremely strong smell for a baby cream. Smells like my old aunt's perfume and I can't believe this can be good for my baby's skin. Don't buy this because it will sit on your drawer.,0
This product is a SUPER buy for the money. I have 4 month old twins so it's perfect for carrying around one in the carrier and the other on the hip to go for a quick walk in the neighborhood. It's easy to place the child in and take them out. I highly recommend this product to all parents of infants.,1
"I have owned several lightweight strollers and this tops them all. It steers well. It has a great basket considering it is lightweight. Steers like a charm, which has been my problem with lightweights from the beginning of time. You can literally steer this stroller with one hand. The blue is a great color and very neutral. Cupholder is ok, but that is not why I bought it. You will not regret if you buy this in ANY color.",1
"I guess I can understand why some people like this carrier. Once you have the baby in it, it is comfortable to wear. However, if you are taking the baby out and putting him back in repeatedly (say, for example, while running errands) for short periods of time, you will get sick of it quickly. It is not easy to balance a baby, especially a larger baby, while attaching the sliders and buttons. I also got uncomfortably hot wearing this carrier, which is padded and almost feels insulated, holding the baby's body heat against me. Furthermore, my baby was unhappy in it, but that is primarily because he never liked being confined in any way.To sum up:This is a good carrier to wear with a small baby, for extended periods of wear, in cool weather.This is not a good carrier to wear running errands or for short periods of time, for a larger baby, or in warm climates.If your baby hates confinement like my son did, you probably won't find any baby carrier satisfactory.",0
"I have born free stage 1 nipples that came with the bottles, and these seem even softer, which i thought was strange. It's not a good thing or a bad thing though, just an observation. These nipples are great for my 15 week old. I noticed he was getting fussy while eating, and I think he wasn't getting milk out fast enough. Ever since he's used these, he finishes his bottle in half the time it used to take, and he's happier!",1
"We have been using this table for 1.5 years now and it has held up well to daily use. My only complaint is that the bottom two shelves are not supported underneath, so when any sort of weight is put on them, they sag. The bottom shelf in my unit is constantly coming undone from the sides and falling thru to the floor.",0
"I don't have this changer but someone I know is requesting this as a baby shower gift. I saw this changer at the store and it really doesn't look sturdy at all. I am a new mom and I wouldn't purchase this. They grow out of this right away and if you have an active baby at 4 months, this is no longer of use. The only good thing about it is that it is affordable, but I just dont recommend it, for safety reasons. Also, I do recommend that if you are getting a dresser, Babies R Us carries the changer that you can place on top of the dresser( looks like a little mattress, just the right size), you can have your changer and once the little one outgrows it you can put it away and you can place frames and other cute things on the dresser. I hope this is of use to some.",0
"We bought the snugRide infant car seat but it was already too small when our son turned one month (he was approx. 10.5 lbs). As he is a winter child, when we dress him up in a snowsuit, the straps no longer buckle up. We were forced to put the straps over his shoulders only, which was obviously not safe. If your child is above average weight and you are planning to use the car seat over winter months, consider getting a convertible car seat right away. One more thing ... the car seat is VERY HEAVY, especially with a 10+ lbs newborn.",0
"Please don't listen to the other comments. First of all, these are not intended for drawers. Take a look at the picture people! They are for cabinet doors! If you install them on cabinet doors (even nice ones) like I did, they work fine!",1
This swing is a life saver. We have traveled with it everywhere. It is so easy to fold up and transport not like other swings. Our son will sit in it for ages. The music and scenery keep him occupied. He has also fallen asleep in it many times. It calms him down when he is over tired and trying to fall asleep. I would recommend this to anyone. Our son is now 4 months old and we have used it since the week he was born and still do today.,1
"Initially I liked this product, but after about 9 months the hinges rusted and eventually broke off. Now there is no inner lid to keep the smell out and it is stinking up the house. I tried contacting the company for a replacement, but was never able to get a response. Finally broke down and bought a Diaper Genie II to replace the Diaper Dekor. I bought the Dekor originally because of its hands-free use, but now the Genie is also hands-free so hopefully it will work better.",0
"Hands down, this pump can't be beat! The Avent Isis IQ Duo is SOOOO easy to use, I wish I had it for my first child! I had a Medela PIS for my first child and I hated it.The best part is the one-hand operation - ON THE BREASTSHIELD. Other pumps whose controls are on the pump itself force you to figure out how to balance the shields on your knees or something while you adjust the knobs. The IQ Duo doesn't have this problem!Also, the IQ Duo lets YOU adjust precisely to YOUR level of comfort in suction level and rhythm. A DREAM PUMP! I can pump so fast with this - and IT IS QUIET! The PIS I had was loud and unnerving. This pump is by far the best out there.",1
"I got this as a gift on my baby shower & was so happy to receive it! This playpen is so wonderful, very colorful & sooo easy to set it up. I'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it. I received great reviews on this gear also so don't be dissapointed to grab one like it!!! awesome playpen!!!",1
I ordered this because I don't have a lot of storage space and thought this bath would be easier to store than a big plastic tub. It arrived sealed in plastic but when I attempted to use it for the first time black dirt seeped out. I have attempted to wash it 3 times through the washing machine and still get black dirt.,0
"I received these diapers as a shower gift. It was a huge box, and my baby wasn't big enough to wear them for quite some time. When she was, I quickly fell into a routine of several clothing changes per day combined with at least one crib bedding change a day. I have never gone through so many stain treatment sticks in my life as I did while using up these 200 diapers. My baby is breastfed, so BMs are frequent and runny. If she was lying down for longer than 5 minutes after filling that diaper it was pretty much a guarantee that poop was on her clothes, legs, and/or up her back.When I switched back to Pampers, the poop accidents stopped like magic. Suddenly, I was doing laundry just because she had worn all of her clothes and it was time for a sheet change instead of washing that stuff because it was covered in poop. Coincidentally, with my son I also had problems using Huggies. He was not breastfed so the poops weren't a problem. Rather, the pee ALWAYS managed to escape the diaper. After a couple days worth of changing onsies 10 times a day (pee up his back every time), I threw the rest of the Huggies out.Now, on to other comparisons. These Huggies diapers feel like plastic - they are rough and scratchy to the touch. Further, the innards of the diaper don't have that dry-weave layer above the absorbant batting so mositure isn't wicked away from baby's skin. Either prepare to change the diaper the instant it becomes wet (usually baby will let you know), or deal with never-ending diaper rashes.I like Pampers because they don't feel plastic-y. They are soft to the touch inside and out (and so long as you buy swaddlers or sensitive types) they have a dry-weave layer inside to wick moisture away from the skin. I found that the Huggies Pure & Natural diapers were closest to Pampers in these areas, but I still prefer Pampers. The additional bonus with Pampers Sensitive is the moisture strip that turns from yellow(dry) to blue/green when wet. The strip is most useful for newborns because the volume of pee is sometimes so small that it is hard to tell that the diaper is wet. At 3 a.m. when you are exhausted and your newborn is crying, a quick glance at the exterior surface of the diaper will let you know if a wet diaper is to blame.",0
This monitor works so well... you can hear every sound the baby makes! I was getting some feedback for a few days until i realized I had my cordless phone too close to the reciever (the cordless phone also distorts my tv if it is too close!). I highly recommend this monitor!!!!!,1

"I don't review products unless I think they're really great or a waste of money. The Diaper Champ is a waste of your money. While not having to buy refills for it and being able to use trash or plastic shopping bags is convenient, that's the only pro of this pail. It's okay in the beginning when your baby is on breast milk/formula and not much else. But once they start eating and really pooping, not only do you deal with odors every time you change the bag, you deal with them EVERY time you add a diaper to the pail. When you pull the handle to dispose of the dirty diaper the scents of everything inside come floating out. My son's room constantly smelled of dirty diapers. I bought the Diaper Genie II when my son turned a year old and I'll never use anything else again. The refills hold a lot of diapers and there is NO ODOR EVER!",0
"This is a wonderful product for infants not quite ready for an adult tub, but too big for a baby tub. I love how it fits perfectly into the regular tub, so it's easy to fill/drain and will make an easier transition for when my son becomes too big for it. My son loves playing with the rings and seems to be very comfortable. My brother is super-picky, but after seeing my son's tub he bought one for his daughter!",1
"We have the First Years Day and Night Bottle Warmer (with the cooler on the back) for use upstairs, and loved it so much that I decided to order what I assumed to be the same item without the cooler for the kitchen counter downstairs. It never heated the bottles as well as the one that we had, and the bottles gradually got less and less warm, until the warmer didn't work at all. We used it less than ten times, and the entire thing totally crapped out. I ignored the bad reviews and really, really wanted to like this item because I love the cooler/bottle warmer so much! Back to Amazon it goes!",0
"muy satisfecho por el producto, lo recomiendo altemente para todos y cada uno de los usuarios, es producto es bastante comodo",1
The Baby Papasan looks so cozy for a baby. Unfortunatly my son didn't care for it at all. The incline of the seat is too steep I think. He tends to slip forward so the buckle is what is holding him in. I really wish I would have spent the $50 on something else. He loved his swing and bouncy chair. I would recommend getting those instead of this.,0
I wish I would have known more about what to look for in a car seat before we purchased this one.-The handle is very difficult to move and the loud noise it makes wakes our baby almost everytime we move the seat from the car.-The latching system requires quite a bit of coordination and strength- I did not have either after many nights with limited sleep.- The car seat is very heavy and difficult to carry the baby in. For the first few months I dreaded every trip with putting him in the car seat.-Our baby is now 4 months and 20 lbs- I am looking forward to getting a new car seat and never using this one.,0
"I was worried when my milk production seemed to be decreasing. I read changing the shield size may help, and did it ever. Now I am again able to pump enough milk at work to feed my son for a day without having to pump when I am at home too.",1
"i consider myself to be a carseat gestapo when it comes to getting 1) the seat tightly enough in the car (i expect it not to move AT ALL), and 2) the straps close to my child's chest (NO more than 1-2 fingers under the strap at the collarbone). well, this carseat has been a nightmare since day one! although we can get it in our Odyssey so it doesn't move (and yes the tether is a pain to adjust), once it's in we CANNOT get the straps tight enough on our daughter. i've pulled and pulled and pulled until i literally popped one of my ribs out of its cartilage (extremely painful injury)!!!this seat may be a wonderful booster seat, but it STINKS as a 5-point harness seat. i'm throwing it away i'm so disgusted. i've got a Britax on order and cannot wait til it arrives. i love our other Britaxes (Roundabouts) that we now use for our son since our daugther outgrew them. i don't know why i tried to cut corners and buy one seat rather than one now to take her to 65 pounds in a 5-point harness and another later for a booster.carefully examine your child in this seat if you do buy it. my bet is that your child is NOT in the seat tightly enough to be safe.",0
"I spoke with Natalie Laffe from Angelcare moments ago (they are in Canada). It turns out this product is made by a former partner of theirs called ""Bebesounds"" which was actually sold to ""Graco."" And Angelcare was not happy with Graco's business. Their business relationship no longer exists. All of these boards are unsold inventory from Graco. They are no longer manufactured. Even Natalie from Angelcare said this board is overpriced and that all you need is a board that is bigger than the sensor to keep the sensor from being bent or damaged by slats or springs. And get this, she said it doesn't have to be made of Masonite! She said that wood would work fine. If you want to know if any product is made by, affiliated with, or endorsed by Angelcare, you need only to look at the Angelcare website and click on ""products."" If it's not there, then they don't make it. Hope this helps!",0
"I bought this dresser last week, got it yesterday and put it together... so here comes the review.Some people have complained about the quality of the wood/finnish and I get thier gripe. The dresser is mostly particle board with a wood veneer. I guess what do you expect for $200, almost none of the dresser is solid wood (maybe 1 or 2 of the smaller pieces). However the dresser does look nice once put together even if the materials are second best. I've also read about how hard it was to put together, I get thier point also. But for the most part average person should be able to figure it out.What frustrated me about the dresser was the lack of quality control on the dresser itself. several of the pieces were scuffed/scratched right out of the box, not cool. Also the metal rails for the drawers are aweful, let me repeat AWEFUL! The drawers only open halfway and even then they feel very unsafe. This is not due to how I put the dresser together, I double/triple checked it. Either Storkcraft shipped my dresser with the wrong rails or the ones that come with it are a piece of crap, choose your poison!So what I'm left with is a dresser that looks pretty, but under the veneer is nothing but particle board. And a dresser that I wouldn't trust to hold baby cloths for fear of the drawers falling out on my kid... sooo umm yaaaa... Don't buy this dresser. Unless you want a pretty ornament that looks but doesn't function like a dresser.Peace out.Pabbott",0
"This pack'n play is a good all around, sturdy item. However, this does not travel easily. The entire pack'n play does not fit into the bag which came with the item. Therefore, I gave it a poor rating since to me a true pack'n play is easy to put up and easy to pack away into one bag. Also, this item is very heavy with no handles on the bag(awkward to carry). I do not mind the weight, yet it doesn't make packing it around easy.I think this is more of a stationary item that people use in their homes rather on trips. I will use it my on trips, since I do like the features and I am not eager to do more research on other options at this point in time. Just to let anyone out there who was looking for an easy travel item, this is not it. If you are looking for a more stationary pack'n play with great features in that case this is it.",0
"Great nursing pillow...in my case, it's the best thing for men because you really can get tired when you feed your child with the bottle so this pillow would be something unique to rest on. For my wife is an ok product, not excellent because the pillow is a little bit higher than her breast so when she tries to breast feeding our daughter it gets uncomfortable and difficult to work with.",0
"My son is not 41 pounds yet, but he does not fit in size 6 diapers anymore. I guess it's because he is chunkier than he should be for his height. I am so glad that Pampers invented size 7 just as my son started needing them. Now I don't have to buy medical diapers for him. My son is severely disabled, and I need to buy diapers for him until he is 3 years old. Then the insurance will cover them. Thanks, Pampers, for making size 7. I only wish I could get them in any store!I think the Pampers work great. My son hasn't had a leaky Pamper yet, and believe me, my son has a tendency to have leaky diapers from time to time.",1
"We have two aquarium bouncers for our twin daughers. We have used these from the time we brought them home from the hospital. The two negatives that we have had is that we are constantly changing the batteries and if you have the aquarium and vibration mode on it is a bit noisy. This all would be fine as long as the babies are happy!! The main concern with the bouncer is that at 5 months are daughters began to throw themselves out of the bouncer. Since they were securely fastened in the seat they would be dangling over the side, fastened in the seat, and their head dangling to the ground. We have always been very cautious with these bouncers due to there is not any support on the sides. We had to go and buy two more bouncers for our twins because these were just too unsafe. We feel that safety is the main priority so I do NOT recommend this product. There are many bouncers out there that do provide satisfaction for your little one and provide safety. I wish that I would have returned mine in the beginning when we were concerned about the sides not having any support. I hope this review helps. We ended up having to buy four bouncers because of this and I hope this helps with your shopping decision! Good luck!! :-)",0
"This tray is awesome. Whenever you need to keep baby in the chair just slide this on. I did read a couple reviews before I bought about how people thought it just came apart when baby would pull on it or it would just come off, but that is definitely not the case. When you put it together you need to make sure it snaps and when you put it on, slide the little lip underneath the bottom of the Bumbo. You might need to lift the Bumbo up a little. It's not easy at first but once you get the hang of it. Anyway, its great for feeding or just playing with toys, because without it, its not easy for them to reach the toy on the floor.",1

"I bought this pump because I read all of the great reviews but I have to admit that it didn't work as well for me. I originally rented a hospital pump, which worked great but I decided to save the money and invest in my own pump. I could not get as much milk out with this pump. Also, it took much longer having to do one side at a time. I would suggest renting a pump or if you plan to nurse for more than 6 months it would be worth your money to buy the more expensive electric ones. Unfortunalty, I had too much trouble breastfeeding to continue. My baby is doing excellent on formula but for those of you nursing...keep up the good work!",0
"My son just loves this jumper, we got it when he was 3 mo. old. He is 4 mo. now and has really got the hang of it. It took him a couple times of trial and error.But now that he has the hang of it, it's all he wants to do. He even tries to jump in his stationary play area.",1
"I bought this for my daughter in preparation for potty training. I thought it was cute because it played a tune when the child sat on it. My daughter liked sitting on it and hearing the music and was potty trained using this product, but if I had to do it all over again, I would probably buy another potty chair. This is why:1. The music sometimes doesn't work when it is sat on and at other times it will play when nobody is sitting on it. Also, the little music player eats batteries like there is no tomorrow. I got sick of changing the batteries every single day and after a few weeks took them out permanently.2. The potty sometimes leaks. There is a small gap between the bowl and the chair and I have noticed a small amount a urine does leak through onto the floor from time to time. This can be somewhat irritiating to say the least. I definitely would NOT recommend this product if your whole house is carpeted. Only put this potty on a hard surface were leaks can easily be cleaned up.3. No cover and very shallow and narrow bowl. The chair itself is probably about 12-15 inches wide with the bowl being about 5 inches wide, 6-7 inches long and maybe 3 inches deep. With this potty you have to vigilient and dump the contents after every movement. This is not hard to do during the training process, but after potty training is mastered it's easy to forget when your child can go to the bathroom without your supervision. Without a cover, any BM will make your bathroom (or 'training room') a noxious place within several seconds. After two pee-pees, the shallow bowl will be almost filled to overflowing. If your child is big boned or has big BM's, it will be hard to fit him into the chair or his BM's into the bowl. I noticed most potties are much wider and have a bowl about twice the size of this one. With the royal potty you have to check the potty once every few hours to avoid a major overflow or leakage.4. Dumping the contents can be a pain. To remove the bowl from the potty, you have to get it a hard tug. If the bowl is close to full, this could lead to a mess, mostly on your hands, on the floor, and the nearest object. Getting it back in can be a little tricky, especially the first few times. In the other potties I've tried, removal of the bowl is much easier and less mess-prone.I would not recommend this potty. Instead, I would recommend the Potty 'N Step Stool. It has a cover, and a large enclosed bowl that is easy to remove and put back in place. My mother bought that one for the times my daughter stays at her house and I wished I purchased the same one too.",0
"We used this ring in public restrooms when we were out and about. Often it wouldn't fit the toilet very well and would slide around when my boys would sit on it, even if I carefully lifted them onto the ring myself. A couple of times it almost dumped them in the toilet and scared them to death. I don't recommend it.",0
"I bought this pump after breaking the pump I was given in the hospital when I had my baby. I can't beleive what a piece of junk. I was only able to pump about 3 ounces at a time, when I was able to pump at least 5 oz with the other. I am very dissapointed and I feel I have wasted my money. I would have bought the same pump I had gotten in the hospital, which was half the price, but it wasn't available in the store I was in.",0
"This was not very well made. It is too tall for smaller infants. The dinosaur lights and sounds, barely works, and is impossible to take apart to change the batteries. The tray does open, but where it closes the baby's fingers get caught in the opening which is right in front by the padding causing injury. Baby's once traumatized by pain, will not willing go back to the seat. This is a defect that could have had the opening towards the front so they don't get hurt and cannot reach. It is very hard to move. The wheels need to be rotating in the back as well as the front. Just not happy with it!!!!!!",0
"This is an AWESOME seat. I tried another seat for my son first and the pee guard just smashed him so needless to say he couldn't/wouldn't potty b/c he couldn't even get his equipment past the guard to pee in the toilette. The pee guard moves so you can move it over their stuff so they don't spray the whole bathroom, which I think is brilliant. That helped my son a lot b/c he cried the first time we went b/c it went over the guard but when we showed him how to aim and that the guard could move to cover him he was quite pleased and excited b/c he could move it himself. If you do play with the guard excessively it may fall off, ours has like 3 times, but it's removable so its no big deal other than its gross to fish it out. Don't let that deter you though b/c my son is an extreme mover and fidgets with everything a lot, so if it can take his abuse and only fall in 2-3 times over a 7 month period that is awesome. Also he has figured out how to stand over the potty and pee like a big boy so the fact that it's small enough for him to stand over and pee in it is awesome too. This seat is amazing, just amazing. I researched every seat out there I think and this one is the best, search no further this is it, especially for BOYS!!!!!!! AWESOME SEAT!",1
"My husband and I bought this booster seat because it seemed covenient for home and travel. However, in testing it out, we found many flaws. Our oldest son is almost two and is too big for it already (even though it says ages 6mos to 4yrs), especially with the tray on. The straps that secure the booster seat onto the chair do not lock in place. After a while of my son moving around in the seat, the straps became loose and the seat was falling off the chair. We were very unhappy with this product and will be returning it for the 4 in 1 seat.",0
"Friend recommended this bather. I used plastic tub first 3 months, when baby outgrew it I gave this cushion a try. I have a double kitchen sink; cushion took up too much room so I've been using it in the bathtub. I'd rinse it and hang it to dry and it would still be wet the next night. It's been 3 months now and mildew is starting to form. I also didn't like the way baby layed down flat during bath. I am going to buy a toddler tub asap.",0
"Okay first off I didn't get this from babiesrus because they wanted to charge an arm and leg to ship it. However I got a great deal on it at babysupermall.com , I ordered it the week of christmas and got it that same week. Shipping was free and thats great when you have to purchase something you can't see in person. I love it! Looks really adorable in a white crib. Very good quality and the colors on it would go great in a lavendar or pink room. We did our daughter's room in a dark pink at bottom with white chairrail, light pink above chairrail and white crown molding. Add in the wall decorations and other accessories and its tooooo cute. Go to the website I mentioned to find ALL accessories for this. Also you'll save in the pocketbook in shipping, especially if you want the whole collection.",1
"I read all the other people having trouble with the leaking...we didn't even GET that far!!! It took both my husband and I pulling on the ends of the tub to try to get it open enough to lock it open, and couldn't even get it to lock!!! and when it's open, you can't fit it in the sink...the sling? great, but you can just buy it separate...I couldn't even use this once...returned and got the fold away tub, which is really inexpensive, fits in the sink, doesn't get moldy, and when it dries, I can just put in in a corner and it's hidden, it gets that small....DO NOT BUY THIS TUB, IT'S HORRIBLE!!!",0
"The product is very good overall, it does its purpose that is to keep my 8 1/2 month old, who is crawling, out of trouble. She loves to stand up holding onto to it also. The only thing that is a little hard is to fold it as it is large and I am always trying not to bang to furniture.",1
"I decided to try this mat (in Blue/Gold), even though it has quite a few negative comments. With free shipping and a an option to send it back, it's worth trying.I've seen a few other mats in use, mostly the alphabet one, and absolutely hated the design and colors. This one looks pretty cool for a baby product. I have it 4 out of 5 stars for slight imperfections, like tiny gaps around the connectors, few minor dents on on tiles, etc.One thing to look at while putting the mat together: the texture has a dotted pattern that lines up one way (and goes on an angle the other way). When put in the same direction, the pieces fit together much better.Other from that, connectors sit quite tight, colors, even if not as vivid as on my screen, are great, and I haven't notice any smell to it.A keeper! Even if slightly pricey for a play mat, I'm hoping my 6-month-old will use it for the next 2 years, and with a possible second addition to the family, it could be in use even longer.EDITED - May 6, 2011After a few months of exploitation - it looks awful. The outer layer pierces easily, my stepson chased our dog over it a couple times, and it's all scratched up and poked. I do not expect it to be indestructible, but thought that at this price it would be at least as durable as cheap, $20 mats. It's not.My son loves to pull it apart and chews on it - even tho he doesn't puncture the surface, the foam never goes back to it's original form.I guess it could work better for someone who's baby is a little neat-freak, but mine is not.I still love the design, and it falling apart when played on is not a big deal, but the quality issue is killing me...",0
"Very soft, nice baby blue color. However description states that it's for a contoured changing pad but when I put it on there's some room between the middle of the pad and the cover. It's not tight, when baby gets placed on it, it conforms but when baby's not on it it's lifted.",0

My baby would be sleeping for over a week in the mini crib so I wanted to make sure both of us would be getting sleep. It's firm, comfortable, and baby had no problems sleeping! Don't count on the thin foam mattress that comes with the crib to serve any purpose other than for taking short naps in, or at most, an overnight visit.",1
"This seat is perfect for restaurants, trips to Grandma's etc. We even use it to feed our son when we are sitting on our deck. We use it much more than we thought we would.

"I don't normally do reviews, but I felt that I had to on this one. This stroller is very poorly constructed. I have had it for two days now and already the fabric on the seat is torn in two places and the seat is broken. There are two little latches on the seat, and one of them broke off, so now the seat is crooked. I was not rough on the stroller at all. The fabric gets caught very easily on the frame when you fold it up and unfold it. That's how it got ripped. As far as the seat, I didn't notice it until I took my son to the zoo for the day, and tried to figure out why he was sitting so crookedly. Also, the wheels squeak horribly. I was totally embarrassed driving the thing around. The positives are that it does look nice, it rides pretty smooth, and the wheels come off easily so that it fits in car trunks without a problem. Still, the poor quality outweighs the pros, so I will be returning it. I would not recommend it.",0
"This is a really neat toy, it looks adorable to my 5 year old, the blue and green lighting is really cool. I agree with others that the yellow color is not very visible. However, this light is a constant pain for me. The batteries only last through 3 nights and I did verify that it shuts off after 20 minutes. I bought rechargeable batteries so I am not throwing so many away, however the compartment for the batteries is so tight that it requires a small flat head screwdriver to get the batteries out. This can require some hunting around in my house. A note for the design company that If you design it after a turtle, make it a little larger so you can use C or D type batteries, not AAA batteries.",0
"Pampers Baby Dry are our favorite diapers, we've been together from size 1 to size 6.The only reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars is that within the last 6 months, nearly every box we receive contains few diapers with substandard closures &lt;- the little flaps come right off once you pull them.----On the other hand, we are very impressed with Amazon Mom - it delivers everything it promises, from savings to on-time-delivery.",0

"I own three of these gates and I love them! I have all of them mounted on the hardware as oppossed to just pressure mounting them. I have a very active 2 year-old boy. He will hang off of them, slam them open and close when he can, and just flat out bang on them. I love that I can see through them and I don't have to worry about my son sticking his arms through any bars. The only downside to this gate is that the clear plastic has gotten marks from my son banging his toys on it and it is very hard to remove some of them. Overall, I would recommmend this gate to anyone!",1
"I was very excited to order this gate for the top of the stairs as I have a 2 year old and an 11 month, and both are very active. From the review on this site and the ones on other sites I thought I was going to get a superb gate, as I really didn't care much about the slight difficulty in use as long as it protected my boys. This gate has been up a total of three weeks and my two year old already managed to break it which is unacceptable to me. When he wanted to go downstairs as he obviously can walk down stairs fine he would put a little weight by leaning on the gate in the middle. We always nixed this right away so it really didn't get leaned on all that much. So even with just a small amount of leaning on it he managed to bend the top part of the main base about 45 degrees to the inside!!! This now causes the latch of the top bracket to be loose...you can kind of manually tighten by turning the roll, but today my dog nudged the gate twice (not hard at all) with his nose and totally unlatched the top and was able to get through the gate. Very disappointed. Now you may wonder if we installed this right, and be assured we did, used the level and all.After a few times the lock/unlock mechanism was easy to figure out. I can definitely unlock and open the gate with one hand...to lock it with one hand had to be real lucky, but it is rather hard to catch both the hooks with one hand. As others have stated it is also very loud, but again if it was a safe gate that would not have bothered me.I would not recommend you get this gate unfortunaltly.",0
"I had bought this cause I thought its cute. well its cute but it doesn't function well. My 2 1/2 year old son slides all over the place, its not secure at all. When he pees he pees over and the pee goes even in between the seat so i have to flush everything and clean the toilet. the cup holder is a joke.. it really holds nothing, so i cannot recommend this for boys at all. I am about to get another potty seat, something that will hold his pee and will fit safely in my toilet.",0
"I had this for about 1 hour, trying to give it the benifit of the doubt, but then gave up on it and returned if to the store. It got good sound signal, but everything interfered with it (nearby phones, people walking between the base and the unit, ect) and then the video monitor had a constand roll, despite a never ending tweaking of the V hold dial. I would get it still for about 2 minutes, walk away for a second, come back and it was in full tilt spin. Just not workable nor worth the investment. There are a couple other brands out there, look at them first (like Summer). This is Saftey is actually saftey last.",0
"THESE PAMPERS HOLD ALLOT, MY SON IS NOT BEING POTTY TRAINED SO THEY HOLD EVERYTHING. THEY ALSO WORK OVER NIGHT. BUT SOMETIMES AT NIGHT THEY WILL LEAK BUT THATS IF HE SLEEPS AN EXTRA LONG NIGHT.

This monitor was a gift when my daughter was born and I am so glad that I did not waste my own money on it. The projector quit working after 2 months and the static on the receiver is unbearable. We can't set anything next to the receiver or even walk by it without the static getting louder. We are currently looking for a new system.,0
Excellent diapers! Held in alot of messes. The only reason they stopped working is because I needed to move a size up.,0
"Of course we wanted the best for our son. I read all reviews, compaired all brands, did my homework. Never thought I would have such a big mess using the Avent bottles. My son was a month early so he was smaller than normal (6lbs 6oz-if that is small). From the first feeding he got way to much formula and half the bottle ended up down the front of him. Not because the bottle leaked, but because he couldn't handle the flow and was spitting it out. I was horrified! After two weeks of trying, and it not getting better, I looked for another bottle and ended up with a much cheaper bottle and NO SPILLS! I have no complaints about the bottle itself - the flow is just to much for my baby (yes, I was using &quot;#1&quot; nipples). What a disappointment! I will give it another try in the future when he is older...wish me luck!",0

"I bought 2 boxes of 4oz liners and 2 boxes of 8oz liners and i absolutely hate them. I have both the premium nurser bottles and the standard bottles, and when I use these liners they don't hold true to the ounce markings. I even use a real bottle that has true markings for ounces, and will put the water in there before filling the nurser bottle with this liner. Its almost as i the bottle isn't wide enough. And if I use the 4oz bottle with this liner and try to put in two scoops of formula and you can BARELY fit one scoop in! I received some preformed when I bought both sets of bottles and didn't try them at first since I had the other liners, but now that I've had so many difficulties with these liners- I'm using the preformed and I love them. So I guess I'll be giving away these liners!",0
"We don't use the tub much now, just the sling. My girls are 6 months now (25 inches) and the tub doesn't seem long enough with the sling in it. It might be nice when they can sit on their own, but right now they can't. We only used (well, tried to use)the sprayer once or twice. Now I just lay them on the sling in the tub and use my own shower sprayer. Needless to say, I'm looking for a bath seat now after struggling for months with baths.",0
"I had purchased two of these in order to make a free standing area in our living room for our first baby. Being a first time parent, it is difficult to know what the sound investments will be and this one left me very disappointed and wishing for my $200 back. First, when I put my son inside the area, he was able to stand up and pull on one side and walk it in until the entire structure became unstable and fell over? Thus, we stopped using it until the giant monstrosity consuming our living room became unbearable & I decided To try and salvage the structure by affixing iit to the walls- even though I did not want to drill into the walls in the first place. Only thing was I no longer had the hole template and there were no measurements in the instruction manual to tell you where to measure out the holes. I called costumer service and after a 15 minute wait, was told that they had no template and had no measurements to give me. Being a busy working mom, that even writing this review was a stretch, had no idea this product would take so much time to try to salvage. I would not waste your time or hard earned money on this one, so beware!",0
"At first i thought these wipes were amazing beause they are so soft, but I noticed tiny linty fibers on my son's penis that would get stuck around there. Also the wipes leave an oily and slightly stinky odor on your hands. I am going back to Huggies wipes!",0
"my husband and i were very excited to get this a day earlier than expected, only to be very sorely disappointed that the carrying tote was broken when we opened the box. what's even worse is the metal rod that helps attach the blade to the mill looked dirty and rusted! i wonder if this was returned before!amazon was quick to refund us. their reseller made a complete mess out of this order.",0
"After having a potty seat that you take on & off the toilet, we finally tried this Potty Pal seat. My almost 4yr old daughter can easily take the proper seat down to go to the bathroom. The childs & adult seat is light & will not come slamming down. They all fit in the seat cover nicely & is not akward as an adult to use. Highly recommend & wish I would have bought this after she outgrew the stand alone potty seat.",1
"The swing is sturdy, attractive, and effective judging from the response of my granddaughter. The only drawback seems to be the bar containing the toys across the body of the swing pulls out too easily. This is not a safety hazard just a nuisance.",0
"I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier, then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle. WRONG!!! She hated these bottles. I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder. I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us. The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth.",0
"Good value for me for two reasons. With Amazon Mom and Subscribe & Save discounts, you get lots of diapers for the cash. Also, my little guy had to have most of his colon removed when he was 6mo, which means we have a lot of messy diapers. Pampers keeps the mess in the diaper much better than other brands I have tried. So, they save us from a lot of extra icky laundry and accidents.",1
"I bought this mobile for my daughter because of the educational value of it. Plus it seemed so much prettier and brighter than the other mobiles.I got it home and put it together and attached it to the side of the crib. I was so excited! It plays nice classical music and the little animals are darling! The little circle things spin and it has these little stuffed rings that slide around on it. I thought it was SO neat! A few nights later while my daughter (only 3 weeks old at the time) was sleeping in her crib, she started screaming. I stumbled in there thinking she wanted to eat, only to find that her mobile had flipped around and fallen on her! I was amazed! I fixed it and tried to tighten it to the side of the crib. It wouldn't get any tighter. So I left it. It happened 3 more times so I finally just removed the mobile part from the music box.I called Tiny Love to tell them about my problem. I indicate to them that the mobile itself is way too heavy for the music box and it makes the music box turn which makes the mobile fall on the baby. The CSR tells me that they've had several complaints and are referring them to their legal department? In the meantime they promise to send me out a replacement. That was almost two months ago. Everytime I call they say that it's on backorder or it's already been shipped. When they say it's been shipped, I request a tracking number for the package but they say that they can't give it to me. I finally filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau! This is ridiculous!This unsafe product should be recalled and this company should have to go out of business due to their LOUSY customer service!",0
"My husband and I are gadget lovers, in fact this item is on my wish list but I will remove it. Last night I told him he should develop an app as a nursing log, and tonight I realize that actually there are a few. I just downloaded a free one that works on my iphone/ipad and does exactly what the itzbeen does but it does keeps a record, lets me imput whar breast or (if) bottle was used, what kind of diaper was changed and keeps a log of sleeping times. There several apps that work with android and even one free for any computer. Do not waste your money if you have any kind of smart phone or tablet.",1
This ice pack is specially designed to fit into the Medela cooler that comes with the breast pumps and cozies in between 4/5 oz bottles. Works perfectly to keep breast milk chilled until you can get to the fridge.,1
"I thought I was buying a different ""L shaped"" TV guard, not some tiny rectangle of plexiglass. This is completely worthless to us. Save your money and go to Walmart and buy 2 of those clear 8 x 10 photo frames for 2 for $5. That's what we did in the end to protect our components (DVD player and receiver). We already set our LCD tv up higher out of reach, but the components were the problem.",0
"I didn't have this with my first child and I wish I would have. It made my 2nd experience of changing diapers so much easier. In the middle of the night changes it really helps because it helps with not waking up baby totally by putting an ice cold wipe on their tushy, it's body temp so they barely even notice what you are doing. I think this makes an awesome baby shower gift because it's the kind of thing most parents will overlook when buying necessities for the baby, but it's a really really great item to own.",1
"I bought these with the intention of using with homemade baby wiping solution. Despite others' complaints about the threading coming undone (and yes, it DOES come undone! Ugh.), it didn't bother me too much. However, I did find another excellent use where the de-threading doesn't matter so much. I use them as soft cleaning rags, and even better, as a makeup/mascara remover. They are so soft, and easy to use once and throw in the wash, rather than using disposable cotton balls, etc. I feel slightly better about their less-than-stellar stitching quality when I can stash them in my makeup drawer. (And back to disposable wipes for the baby!)",1
"I received the Avent Isis as a gift before my son was born. I had difficult with getting him to latch on at first, so pumping was important. i was really hesitant to use the Isis, thinking that it would not work. I tried using it before my milk came in and it really didn't work so well, but i was using a Medela Symphony pump in the hospital to express (before my milk came in) and that didn't even work that great, there's not much to pump in those days. However, once my milk came in the Isis really did work! It was a life saver to use to relieve engorged breasts and express bottles until my son latched on. It's super convenient because you can walk around and pump at the same time. It help if you lean forward when you start pumping to get the flow going and if your hold the handle down for a couple seconds to create more suction. If you use it correctly it doesn't hurt at all. I like the soft rubber insert for the cones and you can easily move the pump around to stimulate more milk ducts. I pump into the small bottles and then pour into a freezer bag. I am able to pump sometimes over 4 ounces in 10-15 minutes. It's also great to take on weekend trips because it's so small.Some cons (which should not prevent you from buying this pump): lots of pieces to separate and clean; makes a squeaking sound when you pump so i can't pump around my son when he's sleeping; obviously can't pump both breasts at the same time; you have to pay attention to what your doing to make sure the milk is flowing.I'm so glad that i received this pump as a gift and recommend it to all breast feeding moms to keep as an emergency pump. I plan to buy an electric pump for when i go back to work. I will be able to leave the electric pump at work and just use the Isis at home.",1
"We exchanged another bottle warmer for this one and we were incredibly disappointed. The bottle is never the right temperature and the water levels for the side vials are incredibly hard to achieve. It has boiled MANY bottles right over the side and onto the counter, causing a huge mess and horrible smell-think fried baby formula. It has also boiled bottles over onto our bedroom carpet at 3 a.m. Additionally, we have twins and it won't warm another bottle after the initial one for ten minutes. Save your money!",0
"The bath station was incredibly hard to lock in. I had to actually stand the bath station on the floor, push my foot down on one end and pull up on the other. After struggling with the lock, it leaked. Not a flood but there was a good sized puddle on my kitchen counter. I tend to keep my bath time around 5 minutes because of this. As for the sling, it's not the greatest thing either. My daughter keeps sliding down it. Besides, after being wet for a few minutes it gets pretty cold and my daughter starts screaming. I don't necessarily hate this tub, but I really wouldn't recommend it.",0
"If you are using the Avent products, this is the ultimate solution for storing breastmilk. Here's why I love them:You can pump right into the container (if you use a Medela pump you need to buy a $10 avent adapter, available online, otherwise you pump into the containers that came with your pump and then transfer the milk). The containers come pre-sterilized, so you take one out of the box, hook it up to the pump, and fill it up. Then you put the lid on, label, and freeze (or refridgerate). When you're ready to feed baby, you take the lid off and put on the included converter, which attaches these containters to any avent nipple! The containers are like Tupperware: reuseable, washable, easily stackable, tip-resistant, and cute. Oh, best of all, these are less expensive than using bottles or breast milk containers, and much easier to deal with than the bags. The Medela containers tip easily and do not stack, making them a bit of a pain. If you are using Avent, these are a wonderful product.",1
"I gave this moniter two stars because I really love the *idea* of it, but I am shocked at all the 5 star reviews it received. I have had this moniter for almost a year, and just started using the sensor pad part of it around 4 months ago. Like many other reviewers, I have had countless false alarms with this moniter. Any parent knows that being awakened in the middle of the night thinking that your child is not breathing is the scariest thing in the world. Imagine having it happen over and over and over again, night after night. No matter how much I tell myself the moniter is malfunctioning and that is why the alarm is sounding, that initial beep still gives me an adrenaline jolt every time I hear it. I have also noticed no real rhyme or reason to the false alarms, though I am sure that it happens more often when my daughter has moved into a corner of her crib. I can't imagine that my daughter is the only child that moves around quite a bit in her sleep, so to me this seems like an obvious oversight in the design of the product.",0
"We used this light/womb sounds since our daughter was born when she sleeps. The voice activation works once she's really crying, but puts her right back to sleep. The light is not too bright, but soothing and enough to see at night. We have really enjoyed this product.",1
"We have used these diapers from day 1 for my now 5-month old. I LOVE the wetness indicator stripe, it is so convenient! A month ago when we ordered a huge box of 1-2's they had the wetness indicator. This time (same size, same size box) they didn't! Packaging is exactly alike, but sometimes you get it and sometimes you don't??? I really hope they are not phasing it out and putting it only on the sensitives, and I wish you could tell if the diapers have the stripe by the outside packaging. It is a total shot in the dark whether or not the stripe will be on the diapers once you open the box... and when it's not there it's a total bummer :/",0
"I bought two of the pads for a Graco Pack and Play. I made sure to try them to ensure a good fit before washing them and pre-wash they fit perfectly. One cold wash and a tumble dry and they shrunk to the point where they no longer fit and are unusable. They are so small that they make the PNP mattress fold up on itself. A waste of money and I cannot return them now that they have been washed. Not sure what would happen with a cold wash and a line dry, but be warned.",0
"I love A&D ointment and use it on my son's bottom at EVERY diaper change to prevent diaper rash. He is almost 2 and has never had a bad case of diaper rash. This price is crazy, in the store the same item is under $5 and the one pound tub is about $11-$12. So $10 for 4 oz. is definitely WAY overpriced.",1
"This was not a very wise purchase on my part. I wish I'd done a little more research when looking for a bouncer (why this even comes up in a search for bouncers is beyond me...it doesn't bounce!). My son only used this a handful of times. The vibrating made him instantly upset, and while it's a nice feature that the music shuts off on it's own, there should be a setting to make it stay on for longer if you so choose. There was NO bouncing with this chair, so he just kind of sat there...bored. I used it more as a place to set him while I did a quick chore or two around the house. In the end I think this chair is WAY overpriced for what it is...basically a stationary seat with some very soft cushions and a little vibration and music. I say pass...you can find better for cheaper.",0
"Delivery of the blanket was fast, I also liked the look of it. However the striped fabric started coming apart at the edge, where it is sewn to the grey border. The stitches are intact, but since the striped fabric has no firm edge, it is dissolving into single fibres. The padding is visible now. I will try to fix it using textile glue, but it is only a question of time, until the fabric will come off all around the border. Quite disappointing! (I tried to upload a picture, but this did not work).",0
"Very disappointed. It is a colorful piece of plastic, no cushion at all! Bought it for a high chair as a replacement cushin.",0
"I bought this chair for my 6 month old son, for when we go out to eat. It has been wonderful! Easily attaches to the table. I have some trouble getting it off the table. I wish there was an easier way without killing your fingers (or nail in my case). Other than that, it works perfectly.",1
"The box itself is beautiful, but the hinge already broke. Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It broke and hit my son in the head. Poor thing has a huge bump!",0
"I bought this pump while still pregnant and threw away the packaging. Now I'm stuck with a useless product. I have tried several times to use it and am unable to express more than 1/2 oz. of milk...and that takes a half hour or so to do. And, this is with an extremely heavy milk flow. I also have another pump (it's the yellow, manual breast pump, ... also for sale at babies r us), and even though alot of work I'm able to use that one successfuly.",0
"I was first disappointed in the delivery.It took close to a month for me to receive the product and 2 phone calls to the shipper.When I tried to put the chair together,where 2 metal sides slide together to form the arm...one side had pieces of sharp metal in the arm where it had been welded.This prevented the two pieces from clicking together.I attempted to file down the pieces and was able to snap the pieces together ,but they did not click in place and now will not disconnect!I did try to fit the tableonto my kitchen islad ,which is a big farm table.The chair will not fit,as the table is thick.I then tried it on my dining table,which is thein,but with a lip running underneath so it won't fit.I am sending it back.Very disappointing!!!!",0
"For some reason this nail cutter is listed under toys. So when it came to rating, of course I am going to say this toy is not much fun and does not have educational value. Must be an Amazon error.Other than that, I love to cut my baby's fingernails and toenails with this. It is simple and makes cutting nails painless. The price is also something I love. I don't know why parents use the metal nail clippers when baby scissors are so much safer and easier to handle.My only complaint is that the finger hole is a bit small for men's fingers, if daddy wanted to cut baby's nails.",0
"After putting together this stroller I learned the front fender was rubbing up against the front tire. I called the manufacturer and after being on hold for 30 minutes they sent me a new front fender. The new front fender rubbed up against the tire even more. I called the manufacturer again and this time was on hold for 40 minutes. Their solution was to loosen the front tire and move it forward and retighten it. This solved the problem of the fender, but now the brakes do not line up properly with the front tire and they rub up against the rubber on the tire. Take my advice, stay away from this poorly designed piece of junk.",0
"I`m from mexico city and i`m lookin for a triplet stroller because my wife is expecting triplets, i`ll apreciatte if someone could send me information for this kind of strollers in the US, please send the information via e-mail to jorgesald@hotmail.com, i read the reviews here so i don`t need to check the quality of this beckendridge stroller, thanks.",1
"I really love the idea of a doorway bouncer, so I was thrilled when MIL got us a Johnny JumpUp. When we put our baby in it at 4 months, though, I realized it does not offer enough support for a small baby. It has a wide range of adjustability, which is awesome, but my baby just slumped so uncomfortably in the seat, not at all like the happy looking older baby on the box.I bought the Graco Jumpster instead, and loved the way he fit in the seat, loved the way it bounced and twirled, but didn't love the way we already had to set it on the highest setting. My baby is big - 16lbs, 4oz and 26 1/2 inches at his 4 month check-up - but he's not THAT big!I returned it and instead bought the Jumperoo, which offers better adjustability (like the JJU) PLUS seat support (like the Jumpster). Everyone raves about the Jumperoo, and my baby seemed to like it in the store, so I thought it would be a good product.However...The jumping motion is not as smooth as the Jumpster's, nor can the baby spin and twirl as in the Jumpster.While it is ""portable,"" moving it from room to room is no where near as easy as moving the Jumpster.The toys on the tray seemed like a nice idea at first, but they rattle so much as the baby jumps that they are irritating. Yes, you can remove the toy unit but then what is the point?And it takes up way too much room. If you are ready to take down your swing, or have unlimited space, this is fine, but we still use our swing for naps and our house is already overrun with baby gear. (I suspect a lot of people are in the same boat!)So back to the store with the Jumperoo and home again with the Jumpster.I use those linky rings you can buy to attach toys between the straps so my baby has toys to play with that are less rattly than the Jumperoo toys.After buying this item for the second time, my husband discovered that it actually IS possible to shorten the length of the hanging strap considerably without altering the product. You just have to read the directions more closely than I did at first... oops.I know a lot of people think doorway jumpers are unsafe, but I really can't imagine this item coming lose from the doorway and hurting my child. It is easy to move (the JJU is VERY tough to relocate) yet doesn't come open so easily that I can see it happening accidentally. The components also seem to be connected in such a way that I can't see anything coming lose and allowing my child to fall out of the device. Other reviewers have complained of this happening; perhaps the item has been improved since then?",0
"This is the best thing ever. my older son never had one of these blankets. My mother in law bought one for my new baby, and I wish I had one ten years ago! I am always scared of the scary loose blankets in the crib. This takes away all of that fear.",1
"I used the diaper champ when my son was about 18 months old. It does not keep odor out, sometimes diaper gets stuck, making a big mess! After awhile it smell even when empty... I prefer using the DG, it's more sanitary and really does the job",0
"I RECEIVED THIS AS A SHOWER GIFT FOR MY NOW 3 MONTH OLD LITTLE GIRL. I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A GREAT IDEA, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE PRODUCT WAS MADE A WHOLE LOT BETTER. FIRST OF ALL THE MACHINE SHOULD BE BATTERY OPERATED NOT PLUG IN. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAT WAY. SECOND OF ALL IT DRIES THE WIPES. LASTLEY THE UNDER COMPARTMENT IT TOO FLIMSY TO HOLD ANYTHING. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. EVEN IF YOU RECEIVE IT AS A GIFT RETURN IT FOR STORE CREDIT AND GET SOMETHING YOU CAN REALLY USE.",0
"Going on 6 months of daily use on a twin bed by a 3-year old boy without any falls.I don't use the slide-in feature much, but when I do it works fine.Strap adjustment underneath takes some fine tuning to find the balance between snug fit and being able to get the blankets tucked in.Was a little worried that the cloth sides wouldn't hold up, but there hasn't been any problem.The construction is sturdy enough to handle being climbed over several time, and on the 1 occasion when that resulted in a bent hinge/locking bracket, the metal was easily straightened with a pair of pliers.",1
"I would love to like these but each time I use them, they cause hundreds of bumps on my baby's skin. Even though I love the scent, I imagine it is not good for a baby's new skin. I have great success with Seventh Generation wipes.",0
"If I could give these a no star review I would. These are the worst child safety locks I have ever used. I bought these thinking, ""What an easy install these will be. No drilling and magnet lock to open."" That is true, they are easy to install, the magnet key is a great idea too. What is bad is half of them broke before they could even be used. You end up having to slam the cabinet doors to get the stupid things to latch and when you slam the doors shut not only do you break the latch mechanism but you also risk waking up any sleeping baby you may have in the house. Half of them don't even latch inside the cabinets and they aren't broke, they just are a stupid product. For the money that these cost you would think that they would be a great product but when the product is made in China what do you expect. Now I get to spend more time and money buying different locks on Amazon.Even if I were to contact the seller and see what they could do to make things right for me it wouldn't help. If they were to send out more they would just break too. Worst product ever! Don't waste your hard earned money on these when you can buy cheaper products and spend the remaining money on fun things for your baby to play with.",0
"I was really surprised w/this item. We're expecting our first baby & I'm decorating our nursery in moon/stars. I had been putting off buying this turtle b/c of the price and was expecting a small size turtle. I finally decided to purchase & I'm very pleased with my purchase. I just had to try it out myself this evening, it lit up our entire living room ceiling. I agree with the other posters about the colors. The blue shows up really good, the amber color is really blurry/hard to see the stars and the green is simply so-so. Overall I'm happy with this cute item and recommend it, especially to those decorating a nursery with moon/stars theme and don't want to put up those tacky plastic stars on the ceiling or have to paint the ceiling.",1
I used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old. He woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated. The thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin. I won't ever use it again.,0
"I usually have no struggles putting things like this together and am a fairly ""handy"" guy, but putting this together was just laughable. The directions were blatantly wrong in a couple places, and one of the screws was mashed, but thankfully we figured it out ok and after a few hours we had it put together. Make sure you have a power drill and you may want a few of your own screws to make this work easier for you.",0
"I purchased this unit and discovered on the small seal, NO REFUND or RETURN. This unit was not suggest to be used for our situation and we needed a motorized unit. So I tried to return the unit at Babies R US, they so read me the print on the stickers and told me to call ISIS. I call and ISIS told me to talk to Babies R US. I call Toy R Us customer service and they told me to to call ISIS.In short I am out $60 due to nobody will accept my return request.Be smart and don't make the same mistake.",0
"I bought this bottle warmer, because the previous model from the same company broke. When I got the new version of ""The First Years Night and Day Warmer System"", I was shocked on how short the electric cord was. I was also displeased with having to unplug it, in order, to turn it off. I am not happy with the new model. I would try a different brand, if you need a bottle warmer.",0
"I have had a terrible experience with Pamper's Cruisers. My daughter is 14 months old and has only had one serious rash (a result of strong antibiotics). I had never used pamper's cruisers until last week. I had a coupon and thought I would give it a try. In less than a week my daughter broke out in the worse rash I had ever seen! There were open blisters and nothing I tried seemed to provide her any relief. My Aunt happened to see a story on the news about the diapers so I switched back to my generic brand (Target diapers are great, by the way) and within 48 hours her rash was almost completely cleared up. I am convinced it was the diapers that caused the reaction.",0
"I was very happy with the purchase and delivery of my item. It's very hard to find OU apparel for small children, but I finally found a giftset that gave me what I wanted.",1
This pillow is so big and bulky. It is so uncomfortable and takes up sooo much room in my bed. I tried using it many nights in many different positions and nothing worked. I'm only in my first trimester...I can't imagine trying to get comfy with this thing in my third trimester. Worst pregnancy product I ever bought.,0
"Solid product. Smart design. A weighted piston drops the dirty stuff into the container while keeping an air tight seal. I think it is overpriced for what you get, but it is the best designed product available, so it is worth paying for.",1
"My son wanted the pillow pet that lights up for his B.Day. After researching that and seeing it was taking 6 weeks to 3 months to receive, I started looking for something similar. I am so glad I did. Some reviews I have read on the pillow pet light up haven't been impressive.This, the Twilight Turtle, sounded like a safer bet, so I ordered it. The one bad thing I can say about it, and agree with on some other reviews, the amber/yellow lights do show up if the room is completely void of light and has a low ceiling. Our bedrooms have very high ceilings, using the blue or green lights, the stars cover the ceiling and part of all four walls. Even with the street lamp out front that does shine some light into his bedroom, the little turtle still manges to shine well. I've already got a request from my husband for one for our room. As stargazers, we all love this product and the auto shut off is a great addition. Would HIGHLY recommend this. It even outshines the round plastic light up stargaze globe that is so popular. Also, Though I wouldn't recommend it to be given as a toy to a young child that may play rough with their toys, the shell is hard enough to take a few falls, as well as overall being lightweight and the body soft and cuddly. Just an Awesome item.",1
"I have nothing but great things to say about the d.g. I empty it every other day and it never smells....and I mean never! The re-fills typically last for about 3 weeks-so I find it to be very affordable. I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for an easy, cheap, convenient way of disposing of diapers.",1
"The first impression of the bag is nice, seems to be good materials and a nice design with great features. Then you start using it and realize that all the stitching holding the straps/handle on come apart and unravel very easily. They need to take another look at finding a better method for attaching the straps to this bag because the current construction method is very bad. I did not have the bag long enough to test the durability of the rest of it, as soon as the straps started coming off I returned it to Amazon. I only had the bag for a total of 4 days. I am still waiting for my money to be refunded but so far Amazon as a whole has been great, unfortunately with this bag you just don't get what you paid for. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1 is for design, and because I can't say the rest of the bag is faulty since I did not keep it long enough to test that.I hope this helps in the decision making.",0
"I bought this chair for a vacation and to use at restaurants at home. My baby doesn't fit comfortably in restaurant high chairs, so I was looking for something more comfortable and safer. The fabric is nice and the chair is well padded. The straps are great and secure. BUT I couldn't get it onto the tables. I tried 5 different tables. If the chair went on, it was difficult to manuever. Most tables just didn't work because the table skirt was too big or because the surface under the table wouldn't accommodate the chair. I returned it because it was too frustrating to drag it out and have it not fit.",0
"This stroller has been great and I have no complaints. I actually have the version with the speakers and music box compartment; I bought it rather than the traditional jogging stroller because I have to have music when jogging. It's not a jogging stroller--the box even says so, but I haven't had one issue while jogging (mostly stares as to ""where is that music coming from!?""). Furthermore, I walk to my local grocery store (1-3x a week) and use the HUGE basket for my grocery cart and then walk home. It's awesome! There has many great features to this stroller, and the price is really good considering what you get. Very happy with this purchase!",1
"Its really a great product, its so invisible that you dont realize that you have covered the sockets.",1
"At close to $200, I was hesitant whether or not I needed a double stroller, but when grandma offered to help me pay for this one, I decided to give it a try.Now I can not say enough about this stroller. My kids, ages 4 and 5 (2 and 3 when we started with this stroller) love it. They would always argue to sit in the single stroller, but now that they have the option to both ride, sometimes they both do and sometimes just one does. Now that they are older we sometimes simply use it to carry our extra coats and things that are too big for a diaper bag.It is easy to push, and you simply apply a little pressure on the handles to lift the front for sharp turns. There is a large area underneath for snacks, diapers, and such. The seats lean back for different levels for each kid as an individual. The shade is big enough to shade both kids and has a window to look through to see your little one.I cannot say enough.",1
"I have this in pink/white version for girl nursery. It looks great & works very well. After much back & forth, I decided on this one (at first I didn't use a diaper pail at all!) I kept thinking the more expensive pails would be much better... They are not! My friend has a more expensive one (Dekor?), you have to actually push the diaper thru the neck of the trash to get it through--yuck!! This one you just throw the diaper in & flip the lever & you are done! Easy & simple design, reasonably priced, pretty in pink and it doesn't stink!",1
i have been looking for a diaper bag that wasn't too big. this bag is a perfect size to hold my 2 kids things. i love the two zipper pockets that are perfect to find things. i ordered the corduroy blue. don't care for corduroy too much. also if the pockets were magnetic enclosure instead of velcro then much better. still great.. got it for 20 with free shipping.. very happy with it,1
Do NOT buy this tub. Buy something that is one solid piece...unless you are just going to stick this in your bathtub because it will leak all over the floor.,0
"After reading all the rave reviews, I ordered this product. After I opened it, I found that the construction quality was poor and the directions were equally disappointing. Not sure what the others were so excited about. My gate was soldered improperly so that it was so bent that the door could not be closed correctly. I tried my best to bend the metal frame and door but it was just too far off the mark. I am returning the gate today.",0
"Call me ditzy for not realizing that there was only one in the package, but the picture shows 2. I should have read the fine print, but I felt this was a little misleading.And, $8 for 1???? If I had realized there was only one, I never would have bought it. And, I definitely wouldn't have bought it for a 2-year old that is smart and immediately knew how to get the lid off and dump his snacks everywhere!",0
"These diapers are terrible! Most of my cloth diapers were hand me downs- they are thick and soft. These Gerber ones are NOT! I bought these at Wal-Mart and when my 9 month old wears them, he has to be changed every 30 minutes. If I don't change him quickly, the diaper can become so soggy that it will literally drip. It's not worth it. Spend your money on thicker diapers.",0
"If your table has a lip that comes down, just a couple inches inside the bottome edge of the tabletop, forget this chair. It will fit on in most cases, but instead of being belly up to the table, the baby will sit 2-4 inches away from the edge. Also... this is not safe on a small table. My son barely weighs 22 lbs and just about flipped grandma's table over!",0
I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this! The diapers are the best ones out there.,0
"This has come in handy! It is great for the knees, more comfortable than a towel and I like that the area you rest your forearms on is absorbant...no wet sleves. I will get a lot of use out of this over the next few years!",1
"The shower part of the tub is horrible!! It makes noise when it is on, and hardly any water comes out. Mine broke within days of purchasing it. I should have read the reviews first. Don't make the same mistake I did.",0
"While planning a trip to Walt Disney World with our two-year-old, I began looking for a stroller that didn't require Herculean strength to lift into the trunk or Jedi mind tricks to figure out how to fold it. I stumbled onto this little darling, and let me tell you -- it was a lifesaver on our trip!The stroller, at under 12 lbs., is easily lifted and can be toted around on the shoulder using the attached strap. I recently ran across a parking lot in a downpour with this slung over my shoulder and my daughter in my arms with no problems.It also folds easily, just tilt the stroller back on its rear wheels and pull the two levers on the handle simultaneously --'it collapes on its own. Join the two sides together and it easily latches itself and the wheels allow it to stand upright. There is a medium-sized basket underneath that, while not large enough to stuff a Vera Bradley diaper bag in it, is large enough to hold a purse, a couple o' diapers and a package of wipes for a quick trip to the mall. The back folds down and my daughter slept easily during her naptime while in Walt Disney World. The detachable front rail gives her something to hold on to, and if you have little ones you can velcro toys to it --'as they get older, you can completely remove it. Finally, it is easy to gate-check if you travel with your tot frequently.We have since replaced our huge Peg Perego travel system with this little gem. I highly recommend it for all types of travel.",1
"With my firstborn, I went through several inexpensive carriers, never wanting to pay the high price of a Baby Bjorn.With baby carriers, you get what you pay for. All the cheap carriers ended up on ebay or at Goodwill.My incredibly frugal sister-in-law SWORE by her Baby Bjorn, saying it was the best money ever spent on a baby item. So I put one on my registry when I got pregnant with my second. I chose this version because we live in the desert southwest.I put my 5 week old son in this carrier for the first time yesterday. Within 10 minutes he was fast asleep. I wore the carrier for an hour, doing chores and playing with my 4-year-old. My infant son never woke and my back never hurt (which is amazing considering I'm recovering from a c-section). Neither baby or I ever felt hot.Five Stars! A must-have for a new Mom (and money well spent).",1
"I recently came across the results of a multiyear research project showing that those who were taking saw palmetto supplements to eliminate nighttime frequency due to enlargement of the prostate over against those who took Sitosterol which is the active ingredient within the saw palmetto plant, found that the group that took Sitosterol experienced greater success than those who took saw palmetto at much higher doses. For myself, after many years of using the saw palmetto complex, I found the Sitosterol product to work just as well for a much lower price. For anyone who is experiencing bathroom frequency due to prostate issues, this product may well be a suitable alternative to a prescription medication.",1
"It seems like this is a great product but a few things are driving us crazy (which is not what we need right now). The swing stops swinging after you turn on the little mobile. Something about the extra power or gearing needed to turn the mobile and get the swing going seems to fail. We often here our baby girl start crying to look over and see the swing stopped swinging (although you can hear the motor still running). The light also goes out after a certain period of time. There must be a good reason behind this but we find it to be impractical, I wish there was an option to turn the timer off. The build quality seems good but a swing that will not swing well... doesn't get my best score. I have contacted the company and await reply.",0
Can't make a secure connection to the wall outlet. Appliances slip out to easily. Also doesn't work with the old 2 prong outlets.,0
"I purchased this pet fence along with two different pet door gates from Richell. The door gates (not this fence) are perfect, very sturdy, easy to operate and all the Richell products are very nice looking and will fit right into any well furnished home but....this fence has 90 degree ends to stabilize the fence which is a great idea and worked fine until my wife scooted one of the ends against a wall at a slight angle. We heard a wood cracking sound and when we pulled the fence back away from the wall we saw that the top hinge that braces the stand had only about 3/16th of an inch of wood from the edge to where screws were inserted. Well, that 3/16"" wood sliver to which the top hinge was mounted had cracked away with only the slight pressure of my wife scooting the brace adjacent to a wall slightly off angle. Not well designed. The hinge should be twice the size that it is and have much more wood in between the edge and where the screws are drilled.",0
"The Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat is a great purchase. I have the Fisher Price Space Saver high chair at home. I needed a portable chair for dining out and visits with family/friends. I used it twice during the Thanksgiving holiday and was very pleased. The chair is very portable. The seat back folds down, the legs are adjustable and the tray tables snap on for easy transport. The tray table cover is a great idea to keep the actual tray table clean. One of the safety straps doubles as a carrying strap which was helpful. The only drawback is the seat back is a bit on the short side. Otherwise, it does the job for a travel booster seat.",1
"We like simple designs, things that look as normal as possible, considering what it is! My kid didn't need a pink polka dot toilet seat to want to toilet train, but if that would help yours, by all means get the pink one! I say whatever makes the process easier is what you should do. That is why I purchased a total of 3 of these when I realized my daughter preferred these to the little stand alone potties. Suddenly it became important to have one on each floor of our house, and one in a travel bag that we keep in the car. We just use a large tote bag when we go out and use this on public toilets, then clorox wipe it down afterwards. From our research, those portable ones are flimsy, often don't fit correctly, pinch tiny tushies, etc., etc. So we've found this to work well on just about every toilet out there, and it's reliably sturdy and familiar for our kid to feel at ease whenever and wherever she may need to use it. So with 3 of these items, you could say we are fans.",1
I have three of these for my three kids' rooms. After a while they begin to whine when on the wind setting which is the only one which has steady sound. Also the volume doesn't go high enough. I'm buying three new ones and throwing these away.,0
"I love these paci's normally. But when I received mine, they were PINK! The picture shown when I ordered was BLUE, not the pink shown even here while I am reviewing it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the seller, they never got back to me. I just contacted Amazon again and this time they said they would send me a postage paid return label for a full refund. We will see what happens. I looks like they have fixed the original problem so good luck. I know the MAM paci's and holders are some of the best I have found, IF they come in the correct gender color.",0
"This monitor was the biggest waste of money!!! I thought it would be great to have a monitor with a night light and a receiver in each room, and it would have been had the stupid thing actually worked. Within 3 weeks of my babies being born the light went out, you can't hear out of the receiver unless it's up full blast, and if the volume is up all the way you hear very loud static. I couldn't take it back because I didn't have the box or the reciept any more so all I would be able to do is get the same monitor again. So now I use my 4 year old monitor, and it's much better.",0
"This gate looks awesome and I love the fact that it is easily moveable and does not mar the walls. However, my little 15 lbs non-athletic pug was able to easily move this to the side and get through it. The pugs are not jumpers so they have not hurdled over it, but they can push it to the side and escape. I would not trust this gate when leaving them home alone. It would be fine if you are in the house and just need to keep the dogs secure for some reason or another. I would not recommend this gate unless you have a itty bitty dog that is not intent on getting out.",0
"Using the wheel to adjust this for a snug fit on our toilet seats was VERY easy, very pleased with this seat, it seems very comfortable for our 21 month old. Also recommend buying potty hooks for a few buck each (may be cheapest at BRU unless things change). I have a potty chair for my son but want him to have the option of using the big potty on a regular basis as soon as possible, so I am fitting each toilet in our house with one of these.",1
"I use this for my 13-month old son in his rear-facing convertible and have found it to be a BIG help. It is slightly cumbersome, but it keeps my son's head from drooping to the side when he falls asleep (regarding other reviews complaining that it doesn't prevent forward-drooping... no pillow really will. Maybe try adjusting the angle of the car seat itself if that's an issue). Anyway, I found it helped a lot if I placed the velcro spreader (the part that connects the two pillows behind the baby's head) BEHIND the car seat pad. My seat's pad has continuous slots to allow for shoulder strap adjustments, and I found that threading the spreader through these slots helped the pillows stay put when I take my son in and out of the seat. Also this prevents the velcro from possibly irritating him. As long as you're careful not to interfere with the threading of the shoulder straps themselves, this does not pose a safety risk. All in all, I think this product is about as good as such a product can be, and I definitely recommend it, especially at this price.",1
"I bought this gate after reading positive reviews several years ago. Now I see there are many negative reviews posted and I wanted to add mine to the list.My son is 2. We put this at the top of the stairs. The lock has broken twice and is stuck in the locked position. My advice - do not waste your money on this gate. How appalling that the lock breaks at all, but twice?!!!The first time it broke, I sent the gate back to the First Years and they sent a replacement. This morning I called Customer Service and told them the second gate that we received in December is now broken. The Rep advised it's not covered under the original warranty as it's now over a year old. I told the Rep this is not acceptable and asked for a Supervisor. She put me on hold and then told me to pry the lock out and send back and they'd replace it one more time.We are sending it back for a replacement as we have nothing to lose. But I'm shopping for a different gate for the stairs as I now have a newborn and can't afford to get locked downstairs.Gates I've read positive reviews on:Kidco Safeway (64.99, carried at Babies R Us)Cardinal Stairway Special (more expensive, only can find online)",0
First on we got was defective and we had to trade parts between the originally purchased item and the replacement to create a good potty for my then 18 month old daughter. Things went well until just before she turned 2. I guess she has outgrown it (which shouldn't happen at 2 years old) because she needs sit all the way back and have exactly perfect posture to avoid peeing under the seat and down the side of the pot into the base of the unit. She also has to change position when she needs to poop. Its all too discouraging for a child her size (27 lbs) who might just be starting out. She gets very upset when she makes a mess due to the whole production of having to take the whole thing apart and cleaning it. I think the idea of this potty was a good one but the design was just not thought through properly. I would not recommend it.,0
"Our lactation consultant recommended these...even after I'd heard everyone recommend Avent bottles. So we tried the Dr. Browns, and our son had a much easier time digesting with less gas, and therefore he didn't fuss. And we all know that no fussing and a full belly make for happy babies and happy parents! I highly recommend these, the skinny bottle with the level one nipple -- closest to the breast nipple in shape and flow amount.",1
"I loved this stroller after I bought it...it was lightweight, fit through standard doorways and folded easily, with little effort and was comfortable for the kids. Within 2 years, the plastic connector between frame and handlebars broke, causing the left side to collapse (no injuries).After mailing for repair, I was told it couldn't be repaired and Maclaren would either destroy it for me or mail it back as is. They offered a 'discount' price on a new one, which incidentally was higher than web retailers. By the way, they even gave me the name of web retailers where I could purchase the item for less than they would offer. Terrible customer service.I have found other reviews of wheels falling off another model while strolling (multiple reports) and a similar review of the twin rally model with the handle connector breaking within 18 months of use.",0
"After trying several brands of diapers with my two children, I found these to be the best. They seem wider and definitely fit better than competing brands. They are also more absorbent and seem to be more comfortable. Most importantly, we've had far fewer leaks & blow-outs with these diapers. I highly recommend them. I also highly recommend buying these diapers through Amazon subscribe & save. You get a discount for buying in bulk, and the shipping is free. I never have to buy diapers at the store or clip diaper coupons.",1
"I also purchased the Bebe Prenatal listener from another store. I just returned it today. I tried it everynight as detailed in the users manual and only heard faint wooshing and my digestive noise. Never heard anything as described in the manual...kicks, hiccups or the heartbeat. My husband was always worried that I could not hear the heartbeat and I had to calm him saying ""the manual says it may take awhile to hear it or that we would not hear the heart beat everyday"".... Well that got old, my baby moves all the time and at some point, the heart should have been in a favorable position for me to hear it. The manual stresses to read the directions closely and don't get discouraged...2 months of trying at 6 + months was enough. It only took one month to get pregnant, and that should be the effort, not trying to hear on this device. I'm buying a stethoscope tomorrow from a medical supply store as I've already missed out on 2 months of hearing the heartbeat at home.",0
"While this is cute and colorful, the toys are too out of reach to be useful. My daughter struggles to grab them and gets frustrated. I've resorted to attaching other toys for her to play with. Take a look at the user pictures, most of them don't even have the aquarium viewer attached, or the child is in a trance watching the bubbles. Find a bouncer that will challange your child as they grow and start grabbing.",0
There are two crevices where the tub folds up where my daughter's feet get stuck.,0
"MY HUSBAND PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND I THOUGHT I WOULD REALLY LOVE IT, BUT AFTER USING THE THERMOMTER I LEARNED THAT IT DOESN'T BEEP WHEN IT'S DONE TAKING THE TEMPERATURE. I WOULD SHOP AROUND NEXT TIME",0
"Overall, I was satisfied with the tub but I feel like I wasted my money on the shower feature. I had trouble working it (you have to hold the shower head below the water level in the shower unit when it stops working)and the water in the shower unit turned brown. I used the tub by itself and used a little water bottle to ""shower"" my baby.One other criticism about this tub is that it is not big enough for big babies. My 2 month old is 15 lbs. and he's already outgrown this tub, but I'm sure for smaller babies it will last longer.",0
"I bought these to use for cleaning eye glass lenses but that are sooooo rough I'm afraid they will scratch the lens. They are thin, rough and very odd shaped. I certainly wouldn't use these for a baby-even as aspit up rag!!!",0
"I'm not sure why people are saying this positioner is too short. My baby is very long. She's three months old and almost 26 inches long (95 percentile). She's been using this postioner since day one (literally) and is still using it. She was born at home and her first nap was in this positioner. The bumpers have Velcro on the bottom so you can position them to fit your baby. As she grew, we just had to move them down and out. We haven't had any problems with her sliding. The incline is not very steep at all. The thickest part of the positioner is only about two inches and since it's made of memory foam, her weight squishes it down some. I don't know if the fact that we swaddle her makes a difference though. She's very squirmy but relaxes once we swaddle her. She usually wiggles her arms free during the night (we don't swaddle her very snuggly anymore), but is still position right where I placed her. I don't know if this positioner made a difference in her sleeping since we've always used it, but I can tell you that she sleeps very well.",1
"This is hands down the best diaper rash cream on the market. It is so hard to find, so I always order it in bulk online. It goes on super smooth, no mess, and my 8 month old has never had a rash. It can be a little tough to squeeze out of the bottle, but I'll take it anyway. I've tried Aveeno, Desitin, and even regular white Balmex and this product surpasses them by miles!!",1
"I have used the Wipes Warmer for both wipes and to keep my son's bottles warm and it is FANTASTIC!!! I have 2 of these units, one I use for keeping the bottles cold, too. I definately recommend this to all mothers on the Go!",1
I got this as a gift for my 4th child and only wish I had it for the other 3. My first son had a big tub that I used once because the suction hose never worked. After that all of them were bathed in the sink where you master the art of bathing with one hand - not much fun. This allows you to have your hands free. The two positions make it convenient as the baby gets older. The mesh allows it to air out with no smell of mildew. It folds up so we just keep it in our bathroom - just throw it in the tub if company's coming.I bought it as a gift for my cousin because I recommend it that much.,1
"Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review. They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set. I have to send it back and they will give a refund. What a hassle!",0
"My daughter is now 6 months old, and has been getting bottles since birth (combined w/breastfeeding -- now weaned). Dr. Brown's have been the best. She's now at the point where she will actually drink up to 7 or 8 ounces at once, and after one big burp afterwards, she's just fine. We've NEVER had a problem with her getting tummy cramps from gulping air. After 6 months of sterilizing, the bottles are beginning to leak. I'm going to buy new Dr. Brown's bottles -- I figure 6 months is a good amount of time to get out of them... worth every penny!",1
How irritating to feed baby in the middle of the night with significant leaking from the bottle. I cannot believe that this bottle is even marketed any longer. These bottles have leaked from under the cap 9 of 10 usages. They are easy to clean with wide top and the nipple has a good shape but spare yourself the frustration of changing baby's outfit every feeding. Think twice about this product.,0
"defective item, didn't work. I was given a full refund, i would skip this one, very frustrating, I ended up buying a sony that works great.",0
"This seat is awesome, It is very sturdy and easy to travel with!It doesn't take up alot of room and the tray can be thrown in the dishwasher.There are three different height settings.It even has a carrying strap so your hands are free!I have no complaints with the seat at all, one of the best choices I made!",1
"I love these bottles. Playtex has recently changed the refill to a 10 oz one.It fits the bottle the same. It is a great improvement over the previous 8 oz inserts.I tried a dozen different bottles ans nipples before my breastfed baby took this one. He absolutely refused all others.The extra expense for the liners is well worth all the time you save washing and sterilizing the bottles... because once that baby is here, free time is the last thing you will have.",1
"The item is way overpriced at 59.99 (just a patch of fabric with a couple of nylon straps, and absolutely no structure, stability or style. I didn't get the cheaper ""non-deluxe"" model because it has thick fleece that would get too warm. (And shouldn't the thick fleece one be the more expensive one anyway?) Unless I missed the french fries, they have some nerve calling this thing a Deluxe anything. The cell phone holder is dopey. It attaches to the waist belt with velcro and droops and looks \feels lame, so I don't use it. Playtex, keep your 29 cent mesh laundry bag and useless cell phone holder and put a reasonable price on this mediocre product. Oh yeah, and what's with the tacky dangling straps - front and back? I bought this because my son, at 9 1/2 months was 24 pounds and had outgrown the Baby Bjorn (25lb max anyway). The Hip Hammock claims it's good up to 35 lbs, but I think that's for mothers with cast iron necks and wrought iron collar bones. Carrying my 24 pound son in it is immediately annoying and then painful -- and I'm no weakling. I've tried every which way and every tension. This is probably only good for people with smaller babies, which defeats the whole purpose. I'm returning mine and will use the money to buy the neck brace I now need because of it.",0
"There's so much hype over the Boppy being a ""must have"" that I made sure to get one when our first baby was born. I was very disappointed. It is horribly designed for nursing a baby. The cushion was always slipping and sliding out of position. There is no way to strap it to your waist to keep it in place. For a nursing support pillow, I highly recommend the the ""My Brest Friend"" pillow instead. It's a flat crescent shaped pillow that straps around you and provides lumbar support as well. It made a world of difference for proper positioning, and latching on correctly. If you want a pillow for nursing support, save your money and skip the Boppy.",0
"My daughter was not a good sleeper for quite some time...she slept in this swing at night for many night those first few months. It didn't always have to be moving, but sometimes she was just sitting up enough to relieve any congestion she had. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had an optional AC plug in instead of just eating through batteries.",0
"My 4-month old is very much in the ""bouncing phase"" so I had to get her something that would take the weight off my arms! This seemed like the perfect solution. When I got it the assembly instructions were horrible - especially the leg assembly. It was MUCH easier to put the caps on first and then attach the spring and legs than to do it the way it was suggested in the manual. But once it was together, my daughter loved it. I use it instead of her swing now. The only con is that at 4 months (suggested age) she still slips forward a little sometimes and may hit her mouth on the toys and get upset. I think they should may the toys a little more pliable and not use that very hard plastic. I ended up using plastic links and attaching soft teething rings to the toys so that she could reach it easier and they wouldn't be so hard on her gums.",1
"When my daughter started to get too big for her baby seat in the car, Graco's Turbo Booster was one of the first products my wife and I looked at. What we found was that this booster was one of the easiest to use. The loops for the seat belt are convenient. The back is easily removed when the child gets older. The cup holders made our daughter feel like a ""big girl."" It's an excellent seat overall. The only complaint I had with this seat (as well as most of all the others we looked at) was the lack of cushioning. Other than that, I highly recommend this seat.One other thing that I should mention is that this particular booster fits perfectly in airline seats. If your child requires a booster seat on the plane, I definitely recommend this one for ease of use and its compactness. Some claim that airlines do not allow boosters on the plane. However, in February of 2006, Continental airlines had no problem with us using the seat on the plane. Perhaps the regulations have changed since then. With the way airlines act and react to happenings in the world, it wouldn't surprise me.",1
"I'm not that happy with the sterilizer. I take 3 nebulized drugs every other month and 1 nebulized drug in the other months. The sterilizer was meant to cut my time caring for the nebulizers. For about a week and a half, the sterilizer performed as the instructions stated. Then I started having trouble with the sterilizer keeping the nebulizers sterile for 6 hours as stated in the instructions. The sterilizer would go through the cycle, but then it would shut itself off way before the 6 hours were up. The first time it happened, I thought it was a fluke, but it happened again. I am not feeling that well and just don't have the energy to send it back.",0
"One of THE WORST carriers on the market. It hurts me, hurts my baby. After reading about the pressure and damage that is put on her spine I wish I could burn every bjorn/crotch dangler ever. So, so, so bad. A waste of money and a painful time. So glad we threw this away.",0
"My wife and I registered for this monitor thinking the projector was a great idea. Problem is, if you don't have a piece of furniture right next to the crib, the baby can't see the moving pictures on the ceiling. It would've worked better if there was some sort of bracket to attach the monitor outside the crib railing. However, this is not the only problem. The interference is so bad that you can barely hear the baby. There is a constant clicking and hum. We are currently shopping for a new monitor set.",0
"I liked this chair because it was wood and had good reviews. It was OK when my son was 6-8 months. After that time frame strapped in he could easily climb out. I cannot count the number of times he would get onto the tray, with me standing right next to him. I was always sitting with him, I could never feed him and do the dishes, while he ate 4 feet away. I had to be next to him at all times which I am not complaining about however, it was hard to even refill a cup or get him more food. He could even lean over the sides making me uncomfortable. The wood scratches easily and the straps are not easily accessible. It was always difficult to get him strapped in. The chair is not mobile, does not adjust for height and does not recline. I ended up buying a new highchair. Even before 6-8 months I think a highchair with more padding and reclining would have been 100 tims better!! I find that my son loves to recline in our new chair. I am mad at myself for putting up with the problems as long as I did.",0
"This really is an ideal gate for the top of the stairway. Really safe and sturdy and nice looking too. One tip though, have it installed by a pro or someone that really knows how to do it to get the full use of it. Get this gate- I think you will Love it.",1
"I am formula feeding my son, so we have a ton of bottle's to wash and sterilize. In the beginning we were doing it the old fashioned way by boiling them in a large pot of water for 5 minutes. Yeah, that got old real quick. We decided to break down and buy this sterilizer, and boy are we glad we did. 5 minutes in the microwave and you are done... with out warming up your entire house in the process! It was been a lifesaver... especially when we went camping. My parents have a trailer with a microwave in it, and the sterilizer fit in there perfectly, making bottle making a whole lot easier!",1
"It needs to be a little more practical. I brought this product with the expectation of it being a step one and done type of product. It turned out to be a step one, two and three.... I don't have time. My microwave is easier becuse I have one button to push for baby food and milk.",0
"I have to admit, I loved the idea of the diaper champ...in the beginning. Now, I am looking for another diaper disposal system. My son is only 1 month old..and the diaper champ is not holding up in the anti-stink department. I have tried cleaning the diaper champ according to the inserts recommendations, with no luck. I am also changing the bags way before they are full, to see if that helps...it doesn't. Whenever you walk into my sons room, all you can smell is stinky diapers. I thought maybe I had done something wrong when inserting the trash bag or closing it...nope. So now, after only 1 month...I am off to try and find a less stinky diaper pail.",0
When I ordered this I thought it would have been a better product. I was disappointed when I received it. It does not really work.,0
"This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers, but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves, so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them. This is not a huge deal, and I'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage, but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby. Having said that, when we do hold it for them, they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so. Also, it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it, they don't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else. They actually seem like they feel better, so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing.",1
"UPDATE: I got a bottle of the new formula (new design and smaller pump) and it was awful! It had a funk smell...not sure how to describe it, my husband thought it smelled like moldy towels. It also went on different, felt thinner and cheaper. So gross, had to return ASAP. Also, it's cheaper in stores than on Amazon. ORIGINAL POST (5 Stars): I love this lotion for my baby girl. Goes on great and absorbs quickly. It's like the baby version of Body Drench original (my fav lotion). The bottle is pretty small so it is really expensive, but if it works...it works. Great product!",0
"I read the reviews that these monitors had great range, but mine do not. They have too much static sound and the range is not great at all.",0
"I got this for my 15 month old daughter, who within the last month seems to have become very aware of her bodily functions. She has constantly been taking her diaper off, so I figured it was worth a try even though she seems a little young. So far, so good. She sat right up on the toilet with this seat and went pee-pee within 3 minutes. She was very excited to throw her used Kandoo in the toilet and flush. I clapped and said, ""Yea!"" This seat is great because it is easily removable, has handles for little ones with busy hands, and a splash guard for when this little one gets a little to much momentum behind her pee-pee. I think this is a much better and sanitary option than one of those potty training units. Why try and separate a little kid from that later on when they can start off right on the toilet? And, why possibly put yourself through the hassle of cleaning those things, GROSS!",1
"I bought this stroller nearly a year ago, when my baby was a newborn and my older daughter was 2.5. I had a Graco infant carrier that fit snugly with the universal adapter, but now my baby sits in the front with the snack/cup holder tray. I have been everywhere with this stroller--airport, Disneyland, zoo, malls, walks in the park--and I still love it as much as when I bought it. The parent organizer is the perfect size for my wallet, sunglasses, cell phone, iPod, keys, and water, plus extras like Kleenex and hand sanitizer for the kids. Then I stick my spare diaper & changing pad in the basket underneath the seats, and I'm good to go all day! In the airport, I actually stick the baby in my Ergo and load up the front seat with our carry-on luggage.My 3.5 year-old loves this stroller as well. It's true that with the infant carrier on the front seat, she couldn't quite sit up straight on the back, but that never seemed to bother her. She loves having the option to sit, stand, or walk when we're out. I get compliments on this stroller nearly every time I use it.I read many reviews before settling on this stroller, and it's important to know that this is not an umbrella stroller or a jogging stroller, and it doesn't have the conveniences of both. But I wasn't looking for a side-by-side stroller because it seems like those never fit anywhere, and I don't like the design that has one child sitting behind and practically underneath the other child. This stroller is light, but long (which it has to be, since it's carrying two children). It doesn't exactly turn on a dime, and I have to slow down a bit more to go up and down curbs without a ramp (again, because it's carrying nearly 60 pounds of children). But I've never had any problem with the wheels like I read in other reviews.I drive a mid-size SUV and it takes up half the floor space in my trunk. It can get smaller if you remove the canopy and tray but I've never needed to do that.I would absolutely buy this stroller again, and I have recommended it to several friends. It is exactly what I wanted in a double-stroller.",1
"When i got this in the mail, it was all the same colors and pattern style, but it was like ballerina princess...not Camelot. I didn't even realize until i had part of the strip on my wall that there were no unicorns or castles. VERY UNHAPPY",0
"We've tried 3 tubs and this is by far the worst. You have to fill up the whole bathtub to use it because this tub DOES NOT hold water. You are better off just using a bath seat. It is really hard to change the settings on it and it's bulky. Go with the EuroBath, it's much better.",0
my son loves it so much he sits on it when he doesn't feel like jumping on it anymore.,1
"I brought this chair for my grandchild,so he could sit up and watch his shows and play with his toys, i love it sooo much it rocks, recline,and one of the toys play music. keeps him very busy, when he sees the chair he gets very excited, i really recommend this chair!",1
"This swing almost killed our daughter! At first we loved this swing for our newborn daughter, until at about age 4 months, she grabbed the netting and started sucking on it. The netting tore in to large pieces in her mouth. She had no teeth at this point. I heard her making choking noises and was horrified to find her mouth full of the fabric. She had swallowed some of it, and other peices were caught in her throat. She used to nap in the swing. If I hadn't been right there, she absolutely could have choked to death. Although we notified Fisher Price, and the CPSC, we never heard any follow up. We sent the netting to Fisher Price for them to analyze, but they never gave us any comment or explanation. The swing is lovely, but please remove the netting! It is an absolute death hazard!",0
"My husband had our car seats ""proffessionally installed"" at our local police station before our son came home from the hospital. We were not thrilled with the result as the base could still be wiggled a bit (the officer said it was as tight as it could get in our car). We bought two of these gadgets on our first outing after the baby. We are amazed at how wonderfully they work. Our car seat can be used with or without the base, so we use it without the base in my husband's car, which means we have to totally re-install it every time, but this gadget gets it in there snuggly and quickly! I highly reccommend this product! Remember, the most expensive car seat in the world can't protect your baby if it's not in there right!",1
"My daughter was born just under 5 pounds and yet even with the cheapest of cheap bottles never had even a day's worth of colic. She was never gassy and never uncomfortable. We actually bought and used dollar store bottles &amp; never once had a problem. Imagine my surprise when my 10 pound son not only had an acid reflux problem, but colic as well. My days and nights were hell and I couldn't even enjoy my new baby. The dr. prescribed zantac for the acid reflux (by the way if your fussy one little seems like he's choking during feedings and you're using newborn x-tra slow flow nipples &amp; needs to be upright ALL the time - get him checked out!!!) The zantac cured some of the symptons, but we still were seeing a lot of the colic/ gas symptons. He was still one unhappy baby! So far it's been 2 weeks on the Dr. Brown bottles &amp; not even one colic episode!!! I've actually been getting sleep and so has my son! He's burping and tooting even on his own. Now I have two angels!!!",0
"On the carseat, the handle ALWAYS is very difficult to put down. Everyone of my family members AND daycare had issues with it. You have to press both buttons pretty hard and sometimes a few times.I agree with EVERYONE about the front wheel. But it didnt happen right away. I used this carseat for about 6 to 8months before it started happening. My daughter is 2 now and she doesnt really care but next baby will have a new stroller!When an infant is in the carseat and its clicked into the stroller, it is forward a little much but honestly, that didnt bug me. My daughter took that fine. Shes had a strong neck since birth though.I picked this out for the longevity of it. Its neutral colors, its my favorite kind of stroller (jogger) AND a carseat to match! So it could go through with all our kids. BUT, ITS TERRIBLE!Whats the 5% good thing? Storage! This has 2 cup holders, so daddy and mommy have a cup holder. Also a compartment in the middle of the cupholders for your keys and camera, ect... that is closed so no one can see your valuables. And a strage basket on the bottom. Thats... about it!Do NOT buy this stroller. I would never refer this to ANYONE I know cuz the $200 my mother paid for it was pointless cuz now we need another one for the new baby!And Im so glad I didnt even call customer service to have all this stuff fixed cuz then Id obviously never be able to use it after they get done with it!!",0
"I was surprised that I did not like these bottles at all, considering the overall positive reviews. I found them to leak excessively from the base, and could not figure out the magic trick to get it to stop. In addition, the milk dribbles out of the nipple, so if the bottle gets knocked over not only a mess, but also a waste of hard pumped milk! I don't know if the constant dribble is to resemble let down??? Anyway, would not recommend.",0
"The zipper is like a piece of tinfoil which broke as soon as I started trying it. The mesh fits tight which you want in this type of product but the cheap zipper portion makes it useless, I feel cheated that I bought two of these. The reviews sounded good so I gave it a try.",0
"I have a 14 month old for whom I have used a Diaper Champ with since the day we brought him home. We have never had an odor problem, for the first six months it was in our bedroom. This diaper disposal is excellent because it needs no special bags and is quite easy to maneuver. I recomend it to all of my friends with new babies on the way.",1
"We got this as a gift and used it twice to bathe our baby boy after bringing him home from the hospital. We were excited to use it but when we turned on the so-called ""whirlpool"" we were very disappointed. It barely moves any water, and does so only on one side because the jet is aimed to the left. We had put fresh new alkaline Duracell brand batteries, so battery level was definitely not an issue.Then we tried the shower head, which was very difficult to press and activate. Having to press the button so hard and all the while maneuver the baby is a tedious and difficult task.All that being said and done, we used the bath twice and then it stopped working entirely for the third bath. I opened it all up and discovered that lots of water had leaked into the battery compartment and the solder joint for one of the battery connections had rusted off from water damage. I re-soldered it and got the unit up and running again. A few days later and now the whirlpool doesn't work. Opened it up and what do you know? Another water damaged solder joint.What kind of company designs such a poor product meant to be used in water but which isn't waterproof enough to protect the electrical connections? There is so much water leaking into the battery compartment that my Duracell batteries are rusting away and will likely explode as shown in one of the other reviews.Avoid this and any Summer products! Save your money!",0
"This product came in two different colors! After we unpacked the entire box, we noticed there were two different colors of wood. We were pretty annoyed at this but Amazon was great at taking the dresser back with no hassle.",0
this is a great product with or without the water in it. my son is happy with this tub. the hot water indicator works perfectly well and lets you know when it is too hot for your child.,1
I love the Pampers brand. I have tried them all but these still are the best. We have yet to have a diaper rash and these work really well for those messy diapers. Clean up is a breeze! Also the smell of the wipes is not overpowering.,1
"I have to start by saying I've only used this product twice. I am not an avid jogger and seldom decide to go for a long stroll with my little one in the rain.Despite that, this cover does what it should. I have schwin jogging stroller and this cover worked great on it. From what I can tell, it is completely adjustable and should work on ANY single jogging stroller. It draws closed well, has a back flap for further securing it to the back legs and folds well for storage in the under-pouch of my jogger. Good price, good product, does what it needs to do.As an aside, I did a lot of research before purchasing a cover, online and in stores. This one was the best quality and most flexible as far as what it would fit on and I have no complaints whatsoever.",1
"This is a fantastic product for breastfeeding mothers who are often out and about. I use it all the time with my daughter, who is now 5 months old. She is perfectly content in it and she didn't even seem to notice it was there when she was younger. I am not very comfortable breastfeeding in public, so this has saved me many times! The Bebe au lait is the right size to cover all skin and give baby enough space to feed. The rigid top is nice too, since you can not only see your child, but it also gives him/her more ventilation. The Bebe au lait is SO much more descrete than trying to use a blanket to cover baby. You no longer have to fear bearing your breast to the world! Also,this cover folds up nicely into a diaper bag, under a stroller, etc.The fabric and design are pretty. I would highly recommend getting a light color, like this white, in order to keep your baby cool in the warmer months. It can get hot under there and you definately do not want to have dark materials trapping in heat. The white also lets in some light.",1
"I tried this lotion after reading numerous labels- this may just very well be the only baby lotion with no preservatives or artificial fragrances- even the Burt's Bees for sensitive skin has ""fragrance"" as an ingredient. This smells really nice and light, absorbs and moisturizes well, and isn't oily. It's dry out here in California and we do have to moisturize multiple times between bathing, but that's par for the course. We all use it and no one has any reactions. If they used glass or BPA-free containers and skipped the e-wax, I would have given them 5 stars.",1
"Good concept, but very messy...not only when the baby is sucking on it, but afterwards, trying to clean it is a nightmare..I tried it with fresh banana today for the first time, and spent over half an hour trying to scrub out the fiber! Not very practical...",0
"We bought this car seat thinking it looked really nice and comfy, not to mention really safe. The price was high, but I figured it was worth it....NOT! I have many issues with this car seat. 1) The latches in the front are a pain to line up and stick into the middle latch.(especially with a squirmy baby) 2) The first (and last) time I had to wash this car seat it took me 3 days to figure out how to take it apart to get the cushions off to wash them! It took me 3 hours and a phone call to their customer service(who were very nice and helpful) to be able to put it back together! 3) The car seat is really big. We have a 4 door Ford F-150 and it takes up 1 1/2 seats in the back! 4) It is heavy and very awkward, when trying to take it out and change into another car. I actually went and bought a brand new Graco (ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat 8639BEV in Bevington) car seat (for less $) during the 3 days that I tried to take the Cosco one apart to clean it, and found that the Graco car seat was much easier to snap my daughter in, and much easier to take apart to clean, fits better in my backseat & she loves it. It didn't take up as much room in the back seat. However it is lacking the 3 position incline that the Cosco has.(no biggie) I figure I will use the Cosco in my Truck, since I finally have it put back together and use the Graco in my Honda car, which I drive a lot more. If and when...because it will..get dirty again I think I will just throw it away and buy another Graco. Life is to short to be frustrated over a badly made car seat!",0
"this rain cover is fantastic, I have twins and they can see out while they are well protected. I totally recommend this product.",1
"This came in very handy when our baby was new. It made it easier to remember how long he had been sleeping, when the last bottle was, etc. We also used it to remember how long it had been since we gave him medication, and while he was in the hospital to see how long it had been since he had been checked and things like that.My one complaint would be that it doesn't have more than the last time stored, however, if you have it only to time one thing, see my comment below.Also, the time reverts to zero after 24 hours, so don't try to time anything lengthy.I have started to use it a lot for breast pumping, and work my way down from the top button to see a running log of when I have last pumped. Then besides seeing that it's been four hours, I can see that the time before that was five hours, for example.The backlight is nice for dark rooms, and the flashlight in the top has come in handy. The nursing button is just a sliding tab, which I didn't find handy, since my lactation consultants said to nurse from both breasts so they don't get different sizes (and I'd pump afterwards anyway).The alarm function was used a couple times, but can only be set in half-hour increments, so it wasn't always that useable for what we were using it for.Keep the instructions for clock setting, because if you don't remember how to, weird things happen when you press multiple buttons at once (resetting a different button's time, resetting all buttons, alarm setting...).A good investment, but the reason that we still use it is for something slightly different than what it was originally intended for. Very handy for the first few weeks. After that, the baby wakes himself up when he's hungry, hopefully he's not in the hospital, the diaper gets changed when you pinch the front and it's squishy, and you've figured out your own code for what side you nursed from last. Really great though, once again, for a running timer of one thing, when you don't need it to get through the first few days/weeks. My husband loved it. It made him feel more in control with a new baby.",0
"This is a horrible product. Start leaking with in 2 month, hard to clean. I had to exchange it twice and I end up buying a new DIFFERENT one. Do not recommend it to any one.Unfortunately I can't give it zero because the system wouldn't take it.",0
"I really like this pump. It is extremely easy to assemble, use and clean. It is also very silent. The pumping system works very well and does not require a big effort on the hand muscles - I can pump 5 oz in a little over 5 min. At home I use the electric Harmony, but recently I had to travel overseas, where the electric current and frequency are different than the US. This is why I bought the manual pump and I am completely satisfied. It is also very small and fits easily on any purse. I have been using it for over a month now and I am still as happy as the first day. The only thing less perfect about it is that, as I pump, the handle kind of rotates a bit (it does not release though); but then I just pause, reposition the handle and continue. Also, you cannot adjust the strength of suction so I would not recommend for the very first week or so, until you are used to, or if you have sore nipples. In the beginning I thought it was a tiny bit strong, but now I am super used to it and would describe the suction power as ""moderate"" or 3 on a scale 1 to 5.",1
"My baby is 4 1/2 months old and 14 lbs and is just outgrowing this size. I have used them since birth, although even with the top folded down they initially bumped up against her cord stump causing it to bleed. I find these diapers very easy to use and less bulky than some of the all-in-one diapers for a newborn (a previous reviewer talked about how bulky they were and I did not find this). They DO get very wet when your baby pees. My baby, who wore these since birth did not mind this at all. However, she pees so much at night that we never use them for bed. We would be up every two hours having to change her and she sleeps about 6 hours so we use disposables or bum genius with an extra fleece lining at night.Overall, I would recommend these. They wash and wear well (mine have been used on 3 previous kids and are still in great condition!).",1
"Great diaper caddy. I now have two - one upstairs, one downstairs. Holds everything I need diapers, wipes, ointment and hand sanitizer. And the items are right at my finger tips, which helps, since I have a boy and spray is optional.",1
Avoid this chair like the plague. Your baby will stick to the vinyl and sweat buckets unless you live in an igloo. Thee is no liner on the plastic material and you can't put the chair under the table anyway so you save no space. My son HATES the bloody thing.,0
"This little seat is great. It fits nicely into the kitchen chair and he seems comfortable in it. I only have two complaints, the tray is easily removed and contents flipped out by the baby, and he turns and sticks his arm throught the hole in the back and gets his arm stuck. Otherwise, it is the best chair of the three that I have had.",1
"This stroller is lightweight, but it hurts my back. I either kick the wheels or lean forward and hurt my back. It is something about the placement of the handles, because I'm only 5'5"" so I'm not very tall. The underseat storage compartment is deceivingly small as well. I would not recommend this stroller.",0
"I got two packs of these because for 30 wipes $20 is pretty awesome. First wash they were no longer very soft and the seam on a few of them came off. Second wash, more seams came off. Pretty disappointed, I could have cut my own flannel if all I wanted were frayed squares of fabric.",0
"I was a little hesitant to buy this when I saw the price, but I wanted to splurge a little. I knew the music and lights feature would be important for my daughter, which is what you miss out on from less expensive play gyms. My daughter loves this. She bats at the attached toys. She is too young to use the flash cards or flaps, but they are beautiful. I love the bright colors and the textures.",1
We just bought this monitor for our a 3-month old and love it. This is a great monitor especially for those babies who likes sleeping on their tummies. It detects the slightest motion and now we feel like we have peace of mind knowing that the alarm will sound if motion isn't detected. The only draw back I've found so far is that sometimes there's static that comes through on the parent unit and there are only 2 channels.,1
"This is a wonderful product. It's incredibly simple. It should really sell for a bit less than $14.99, but it was still worth every penny. We have an Evenflo Triumph car seat which is one of the biggest on the market. We also have a 20 month old boy who already weighs 30 lbs. The straps held up wonderfully. Both the straps and our new carry-on roly still look brand new after 4 flights. We purchased aDelsey Helium Fusion Carry-On Expandable Suiter Trolleyand it did the job wonderfully. The straps really do work better when the carry-on roly is over-stuffed because it helps hold the car seat up a little higher and then the seat doesn't try to drag on the ground if you don't hold the roly's handle down low enough. We didn't even need our stroller and I was thankful that we had one less item to haul around. We checked the stroller in a niceJL Childress Standard and Dual Stroller Travel Bag, Blackand it arrived safe and sound. We got several comments strolling through the airport and everyone liked how my baby looked so comfy in his rolling car seat.I also looked at buying theCARES Child Aviation Restraint Systembut didn't want to risk not having a strap between my baby's legs. He's too much of a wiggle worm. This wonderful little strap made it so easy to bring along the car seat and then my little guy was comfy and well restrained for all 4 flights. Not to mention it was a lot nicer to pay $14.99 for the Traveling Toddler instead of $65-$75 for the Cares Harness.Just a travel tip: unhook the car seat before heading down the jetway. Our car seat was too wide to fit down the aisle and then I caused a bit of a traffic jam trying to unhook it in the front of the plane.",1
"Like another reviewer I broke one of the arms while assembling it. Other than that part, the rest of the assmebly was intuitive. The build quality is fairly cheap, but it is probably ""good enough for $20"" except for the arm.So I'll be ordering some super glue to fix the broken part:(",0
"Got back online to research getting a new gate. Then saw the gate we just installed, decided to let others know, it is very ineffecient. It is hard to get it to lock and unlock, its wobbly, and the babies I have 2 can open it quicker than I can.",0
"Got this as a present for a newborn, and my friends just LOVE it. The color stays on and it's been washed multiple times. Still looks like brand new :)",1
"I bought these to clean the sippy cup straws for my kids and also my straws for reusable plastic tumblers. They work great for both. I chose these because they were the best price and came in a pack of four. They work great and seem as durable as I can expect this kind of thing to be. I'm sure I'll have to replace them at some point like I do with all of my dishwashing brushes, but I think they are a great product for the money. They are a little short if you are trying to clean very long straws, but I find them sufficient for the straw of my 22oz. tumbler. I like that these to not have a fancy plastic handle because that means they cannot break off of their handle the way I have read that others do. I highly recommend these for keeping reusable straws clean.",1
After reading several reviews(10 - 20)I decided to purchase the In Step Safari 2 Double Stroller. Very happy Make sure you purchase the Kiddopotamus Ray Shade a MUST.,1
"I received this as a shower gift. I love that it keeps everything in one place and that the items are small enough for use on a newborn, but are still able to be used on a toddler. The only drawback to this is the the nailclippers are a little flimsy, and not as &quot;sharp&quot; as I'd like them to be (especially, when your baby is squirming around, and instead of cutting the nail, you end up bending the nail). The other drawback is that the Safety first emblem on the nail trimmer came off within days of using it..so it's probably better off to take the emblem off, rather then to have it fall off at a later date without your knowledge, and have your baby put it in his/her mouth and risk choking.",0
"This gate is fabulous! Not only is it ""pretty"" compared to every other gate, it is also super easy to install and use. I am using it for my dog who weighs about 30 pounds. I use it very easily as a tension gate. It doesn't mar the wall and easily (I mean very easily) installs. Turn the knobs on the top and bottom of each side and you're done. I had to move it for a day to a bigger opening and added the extensions. Couldn't believe how easy it was. Took a minute without even looking at the directions. I like that it swings both ways, that it stays open if you push it open all the way and that you can adjust the tension so that it doesn't click closed. (Of course, if I was using it for a baby, I would set it up to click closed) Since my dog is mellow, she just goes up to the gate and cries to go out. She doesn't touch the gate. I simply push it open and walk through. I also like that if you don't push it wide open it gently closes by itself. Everyone who sees it loves it. Great design. Thanks to whoever designed it for making my life easier. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Highly recommend!",1
When I ordered this product I thought it was shaped like a horse shoe. I am real pleased with the other products and I will order form you again. Happy New Year,1
"Great product, my son is 10 weeks old and enjoys looking at the various animals ""hanging around"", good music with two volume settings. I like how the animals can come off so he can hold them as well as look at them hanging.",1
"I never write product reviews, but this was one product I had to comment on. I purchased the Safer Bather because my one month old hated the bath. His plastic tub was hard and he would tilt to the side. This seemed like the perfect solution...and it was, for about a month. Then the smell and the mildew started. No matter that I wrung the cushion out after his bath, and hung it to dry completely between uses, it continued to mildew. When I washed it, it completely lost its shape. My son is now six months old, and I haven't used it in months. Also, after buying this product and liking it (at the time), I then ordered another product from the Leachco Inc. Catalogue (which came in the package). That product (a &quot;lightly&quot; vibrating sleep positioner) did not work at all! I now believe that Leachco products are a complete waste of money! I hope this review helps :)",0
"One of the best investments I made. I bought two sets and put them together to make a great big play area. I added the foam ""puzzle"" type mats underneath and my little one has a HUGE play area where I can feel safe with him playing in and at the same time he doesn't feel like he is in jail. thank you!",1
This was a great price took my husband about an hour to put together had no problems! I noticed the other reviews said it scratched easily I think we may have put a couple in it but it comes with a marker to cover them! Otherwise it's great!,1
"I received this tub as a gift for my baby shower. I have four children total, and I have tried many different tubs. This is by far one of the best tubs that I have used for any of my children. With the sling you can easily bathe a newborn. Once my daughter was able to hold her head up, I took the sling off and she now sits comfortably in the reclining position.",1
"I bugged my husband to let me get one. It was on sale, and I thought it was going to be so convenient and smell free. I was wrong, this product stinks - literally. The smell gets so over-powering. I wish that we never bought it. It is such a waste of money! It is such a hassle to empty as well. Sometimes the bags inside don't even twist right then it smells more. The whole unit becomes really heavy too. I regret ever buying it! Would not recommend to other parents!!",0
"I actually bought this product for a teen whose past history makes him quite afraid of the dark. It was suggested we get this mobile because it has a way to set it up on a dresser top, it plays music to cover over the things that go bump in the night, it has soft lighting, and a durable remote so my child can turn it on from under the covers. He was skeptical at first, because he is picky about the quality of his music, but the music is very well done. The lighting has four settings (ceiling show, glow downward which lights the fishies up, both, or neither), the sound has two volume settings, so if we have a particularly noisy night, we can turn up the volume for him. Because it's designed for babies and young children, the parts are durable, and the remote is easy to use, even when he's trembling in a darkened room he can find it, point it the right way, and push the oversized button. The only issues I have are that the remote does sometimes take a few tries to work, and I would have preferred an AC jack, even if I had to go buy a separate AC adapter, instead of it chewing through 4 D batteries. If this thing was designed to sit on a dresser and outlast a child's infant months, it would be nice if they'd thought of other options for power.",1
"Yes this is a lifesaver, but at the same time, it is a big waste of money. We luckily bought ours used so it isn't a big loss for us, but I would say hold off. It is really only good for your baby when they aren't quite big enough to sit on their own and when they are strong enough to hold their head up on their own. My daughter really only used it about a month. It's very akward and she always seemed uncomfortable in it. She spits up a lot in it becaue the middle part of the seat pushes into her stomach when she leans forward at all. It she drops a toy if front of her she leans forward to try and get it. I think when you are at a certain stage of motherhood you are looking for anything that can hold your baby for a minute while you go to the bathroom or wash the dishes or whatever. Get something more like a papasan. We have used that since birth and she still likes it. It has good support and you can strap them into it. Really, this thing doesn't help your baby learn to sit. It only let's you set them down without them falling over. I wouldn't invest in this.",0
I would never recommend this to any child and most children starting on a sippy is teething which makes it even more unsafe. I bought 2 of these for my son to start on. I started him using it at 7 months and felt it was the best to use due to the soft mouth part like a silicon nipple. Well he would occasionally bite down like on a nipple and only had it 2 weeks when I noticed the build in valve was broke and hanging there. I read the cleaning instructions and followed them even the part not letting my son chew on it. I took it when he bit on it and made sure when cleaning it nothing poked the valve. I mainly used dishwasher but time to time would push some soapy water through. To my eyes the other one had the same problem. So I got 2 more and called the company about it worried another child might choke and to see if there was some defect. She told me that they should last a couple months not 2 weeks. She said that poking something through while cleaning or even my son biting on it could break it and if I noticed this it was time to throw it out and get a new one. She did say I could send them back and they would be checked but it was probably wear and tear. I went out and purchased the playtex sippy starters and he took to those. No more built in valves. Use caution if you do purchase but I would not buy any more because better safe then sorry.,0
This replaced our fisher price bath tub when our son became too big for that. It is awesome! He loves to sit up and grab the head while we wash him. It provides some cushion from the bath interior and it's only shortcoming is that we have to use the showerhead to fill it up. I highly recommend that you purchase this inexpensive product.,1
"My baby latched perfectly from birth, but as soon as my milk came in, he stopped latching, and didn't eat for 15 hours. Luckily we were still in the hospital due to other complications, and the lactation consultant spent hours with us trying unsucessfully to get a latch. Finnally she brought a pump in, and we were able to feed him that way. I was very disappointed because I really wanted to breastfeed. I reluctantly ended up renting the pump from the hospital so I would be able to feed my baby at home. Then I researched his symtoms trying to find answers.He coughed and gagged when placed at the breast, lathed on, pulled off and then just started screaming after getting frustrated. I found I had an overactive letdown, with my milk spraying my baby in the back of the throat.I found these and bought 2 of them. He latched perfectly and after 1 month I was able to take them off and will store them for my next baby if needed.He didn't have any nipple confusion after using the bottle, then switching to these and then my breast after getting a little bigger. He transitioned perfectly. He pulled it off with his hand and then just continued to feed from then on without it.I will say one thing though, be careful as it sometimes lifted partially off of my breast blocking/clinging to my baby's nose, so just pay attention to your baby.",0
"I ordered this before my son was born and he has been pretty content to sleep in it during the day for these first 7 weeks. He's not really interested in the music or sounds, but he loves the bug and the sun. He likes the way the light reflects off of the mirror in the sun and he seems pretty comfortable. My only complaints are that the head rest doesn't keep his head from rolling to one side or the other, so I've had to insert a head bumper from his high chair to keep him from sleeping with his head at a right angle. I also didn't estimate how wide a papasan chair would be, which means I can't fit it through some doorways in my house with him in it. I have to take him out, turn it on it's side to take it through the doorway and then put him back in...not very handy when he's sleeping. Other then that, it's been helpful since my son has a bit of reflux and I can put him in the bouncer (without the bouncer on) after he's eaten to keep him upright and from spitting up as much. It's also an attractive piece that looks nice lying around the house. He's almost 4 months old now and he still uses it...I've only just had to change the batteries and he sits in it at least once a day while I make coffee or heat up his bottle. Still a great help even this many months in.",1
"The RaZberry Teether is the best teether ever. My grandson has two, one at my house and one at his house. He absolutely loves it.",1
"I purchased this product.After receiving it ,noticed it was an older model No:810 .The latest tiny love super deluxe is 1210.Please be careful when u purchase this product",0
"I bought this play yard for my grandson who is 9 months old, he loves the different colors. He is pulling himself up to stand and has no problem doing it now. I am afraid though as he gets bigger that the panels will not be strong enough, they kinda wobble now when he pulls up. Otherwise it serves it's purpose in keeping my grandson in one place in case I need to do something. Some reviews said it was hard to manipulate and put together, but this grandma had no problem unfolding it and getting it in place where I wanted it. I would recommend it to my friends or anyone who is looking for a good play yard for the price.",1
We purchased this strap for our Lazy Susan and it comes with tape on the back to adhere the strap to the cupboard but the tape is a joke. I simply pushed on the cupboard after taping the strap onto it and it just pulled right off. So this would in turn be way more dangerous for a baby because if the cupboard held their weight slightly they would try to push up on the cupboard and then when the tape comes loose they would crash inside of the lazy susan and if you can picture that happenning you can imagine how fun that would be!! I've had the worst time finding a safety lock for my lazy susan and I was really hoping that this one would work after reading some of the reviews but no such luck.,0
"I got this for the new baby that's due in about 3 more months. I put my 15 month in it to try it out and she didn't like it, but then again she never liked swings. I just wanted to see if it would go ok and everything. It worked great and she weighs about 23 pounds. I put it on every setting and they all worked well. The only thing I didn't like, was that the motor was a little loud till the swing really got going. I fixed that by giving it a little push to get it moving faster. The colors are great for our new little girl. We'll be trying for a little boy in another 2 years or so, so I should've gotten a neutral color, but oh well. This will work great while we only have our 3 girls.",1
"I like this set of toys. It's a nice variety and great for teethers. One of the toys can be frozen as it has a liquid-centered chewy section. My daughter likes to gnaw on it when her tooth is bothering her.These toys are also great for babies that are just learning to grasp. As most things go for babies, once they grab something, it goes straight into their mouth and you don't need to worry about the plastic that these are made from. These toys are all nicely sized for little ones to hold on to. They offer a visual and shape variety to keep baby busy.I think it's a great set for the price.",1
"I have this tub, but mine has a detachable, padded mesh &amp;quot;hammock.&amp;quot; It's simple, durable, and fits across our tub's sides so we don't have to hunch over to wash baby.",1
when the product arrived it said it was new but there was a safety seal on it that was broken and un sealed. the seal said do not use if seal is broken for safety reasons. the bottles had water drop marks to suggest they had been used and washed. I was very disappointed and threw them in the trash. I figured if i had to pay shipping to return not worth the time. Please whoever sent these please let them know especially for storing breast milk this was so unacceptable.,0
"I've used this nursing cover for a few weeks now. The print is pretty and sublte. The quality of the fabric is perfect for the spring/summer weather - light but not see through. I like the terry cloth on the bottom corners to wipe the baby or myself. I've used a blanket in the past (for other 2 children), but I enjoy this cover with the opening at the top (to view baby hands free) and the size wraps around to the back.",1
This was a great sippy at first but after a few throws it leaks just like all the others. Quite disappointed after spending so much. It was also such a pain to clean. Also bought the taller cup for my older child and the plastic would break off from the bottom if dropped. I am getting my kids off sippys all together now and just getting them some regular sports bottles (Kleen Kanteen),0
"I ordered this after reading many good reviews on the product. However, when I received it I was really disappointed. It's just another junky plastic kids toy. It's not sturdy at all. My 8 month old tries to pull up on it to stand and it topples over on him. It's flimsy and wobbly. I don't recommend it unless you are on a severe budget. Invest in something better. I have since ordered the Haba wagon walker. It's made of wood and seems much more sturdy. In fact I've decided to do away with all these junky plastic made in china toys and start buying less toys, but better quality toys (old school wooden ones). I'm sick of all the crappy plastic. Not only does it look cheap, but it is cheap! Cheaply made. I guess you really do get what you pay for.I gave this toy 2 stars because the removable piece does entertain my son somewhat.",0
I thought the sling on this bathtub would be great for my newborn. My baby hates it. The sling sags (Baby is 8 lbs) and the bump in the middle of the tub digs into his back. I always wet the sling with warm water before I put him in but by the time I get him into the tub it is cold already. Overall this just doesn't work for my baby. I bought a cheap sponge mat that works for now. I'll try the other functions of the bathtub as my son gets older.,0
"The seat easily folds and unfolds, but other than that does not have much going for it.This seat angles my kids very far back on the toilet so that their feet are dangling on the front part of a public toilet.The back fold meets them right at the butt, which is very uncomfortable for them so that they don't want to sit on the seat.It is also just generally wobbly and unstable. And looks like it will buckle inward at any moment and leave them stranded in the toilet.We are returning it for a Potette 2 in 1, hopefully we will have better luck there.",0
"Out of 3 that we bought, this is the most comfortable one.It's adjustable. Stors easy and it has a SHOWER!Our daughter loves in it. The water level is great. There is plenty of room for her to splash in.",1
"I am disappointed in this monitor set.When the parent units are on their charger, I have no complaints about the sensitivity or volume. When my wife gets up in the middle of the night to feed our son, I can hear her footsteps on the carpet as she walks in from the parent unit in our bedroom. I hear every sigh or noise that he makes. They look cool as well.So, why only a two star rating?These monitors were much more expensive than other brands (excluding the video ones). I'm willing to pay more for a good product. The kicker is the horrible battery life when taken off the charger. One of the units had a battery that never held a charge right from the beginning. I replaced the batteries that were supplied with a different brand of rechargeables and it didn't work either. So, maybe it's just a bad unit. The other unit gives us about 45 minutes of time off the charger before the battery light start flashing and it starts beeping. So, even the ""good"" unit still is pretty bad. There aren't a lot of times when we need to take the parent unit portable, but it was a reason I bought this monitor.I can't recommend these to anyone who thinks they may want to use the parent units away from it's base.",0
"I honestly hate the new Diaper Genie. Yes, it was a pain to replace the older version's refills but at least it kept the odor out. We finally decided to replace our old one with a fresh one. (The other was not so ""fresh"" anymore.) What a waste. We don't even use it because you put two diapers in and the room stinks. We never had this problem with the older version. I say go for the diaper champ or the one that uses just regular diapers. We've had success with both of those.",0
This gate is very sturdy. The swinging door is very convenient. Works great.,1
"I bought this for my granddaughter in Indiana and her parents said when she sat it in for the first time she said ""I am proud of my new car seat mommy!"" So I will have to say this was a success.",1
I had lower back surgery and thought this product would be the greatest. It fits comfortably when you eventually get it on but I found because of the Jersey material it starts to droop lower and lower regardless of how tight you have it. After 30 minutes of walking around my house my baby (15 pounds) was around my navel and crying.,0
"Very cute mobile. I use these in my 6 month old daughter's nursery. The sheep are more for decoration then her entertainment. The Flensted Sheep hang in the top shelf of a colorful bookcase and catch everyone's attention as they enter the room. Because they are so light weight and the wire is so thin, the sheep catch the tiniest air currents. Blowing at them from 5 or 6 feet away will set the whole mobile in motion.Even though my daughter isn't interested in the mobile yet, our 2 year old neighbor couldn't take his eyes off of it. I put theWimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobileabove her crib.",1
"After reading the other review, I went against my better judgment and I took a chance on this software because I imagined the potential coolness of it. It was a [$30] lesson. As someone who is fairly computer-savvy, I figured I would be able to figure this out pretty easily. I didn't have any trouble loading it onto my computer but was very disappointed with the product. You can't change the font size or type, you are limited to only a certain amount of space per line and it isn't easy to navigate from one page to another. What a rip-off. Run from this product. Get a traditional baby book until someone writes a decent electronic baby book (potential business idea?)",0
"I have had mixed thoughts on this saucer. My son is a jumper who loves/insists on standing much of the time. This saucer is a great way to accomplish this without my arms. We all need bathroom breaks and I also work near my baby a lot. My son is happy in a saucer for a bit at a time and then I switch to floor and tummy time which he likes more and more as he grows older. Overall Evenflo's saucers are terrific and this one is very nice. My only issue with this saucer is the presence of fixed toys in all directions. Anything that my son sees again and again starts to bore him. My solution has been to relegate this super deluxe model to Grandpa's house for irregular use. At home and office I use a used, toyless version also by Evenflo that is several years old. $5 at most yard sales and used stores. Pop a few baby friendly items on the tray and we are in business. There has NEVER been a saftey recall of Evenflo Saucers so buying a stripped one used is perfectly safe.As for the hoopla about saucers causing developmental delays I say boo hoo! I have noticed nothing of the sort in my son. He is five months old and can roll, push up, pass objects from hand to hand to mouth and is well on his way to being a prizewinning sitter. True, I never leave him in for long and he spends most of his time in a sling, arms, in his crib or on the floor with his blanket and Gymini. But who does leave their baby in these things all the time? What are we afraid of? Parents, as a rule, likely spend more time holding their baby than the time baby spends in a saucer or jumper. From where I am sitting all of the hype is from people who think that other parents besides themselves are idiots who never take their babies out of their saucers or from reactionary and biased self styled &quot;experts&quot;. Let's get real, any product that keeps baby safe and happy for a few minutes while mom and dad get a chance to read a paper or drink a glass of water or pee or jot off an email or write a check for the milkman is a lifesaver. Like all products from hairdryers to changing tables to soda pop bottles there is the potential for misuse. But the potential for misuse does not eliminate the value reasonable parents can glean from saucers. We don't condemn all hairdryers since some people have been electrocuted by them or decry changing tables since some babies have fallen off them. People say that generations past did not use these saucer and jumper type things and that they faired just fine. Yes, while the baby was left alone as a matter of course, often in a crib or pen. In the 1890s the must have baby item was a metal cage that attached to your open window so your baby could air out. A saucer seems like a more baby centered and friendly arms relief method to me.I do, however, think I could have saved a gift buyer the $70 and just bought a second used cheapie. In the long run my son is just as happy, if not happier, with an assortment of loose toys and objects over bright and garish toys that are attached to the saucer.",1
"I picked this set apart and most of the pieces never get used. The aspirator is too stiff and hard to clean. The clippers are pretty good. The sissors are too bulky. The tweezers aren't sharp enough. And the medicine dropper is too stiff to use. I bought a separate 10 second themomoter so this one is now my back-up. As a set its not worth the money, buy the pieces individually you get much better quality.",0
This is one of a few reviews I have written of a product although I frequently read reviews before purchasing a product. This cot was immediately a disappointment. My daughter sleeps on a cot at daycare so I decided this would be a great buy for something to take to grandma's house and on vacation. When I got it out she climbed up on it to lay down and quickly readjusted herself so that she was not laying on the middle support piece of the cot which left her legs hanging off of the end. I can not believe whoever designed this thing actually thought a child would be able to sleep comfortable with a hard piece of fabric shoving up the middle of their back! I placed blankets between the sheet and the cot which helped minimally and will follow another reviewer's advice and purchase some foam to try to make this thing workable. The problem is that I shouldn't have to manufacture something to make this functional and it ceases to be convenient to take on a trip if I have to also cart around foam pads and blankets to make it work! Ridiculous!,0
My daughter hates to be confined but sometimes I put her there just for peace of mind. It's worked beautifully! I will probably keep it for my next little one.,1
"The ""Mommy I'm Here"" is so cute.This product is well made & so well worth the investment!It's water & shock resistant, reliable & very user friendly.We first purchased a less expensive product, it was a terrible poorly made waste of money. And our 2yo son was scared of its bug shape.It only takes a second for your little one to disappear. You always have to watch your child but with this product you can find them quickly.If you have an escape artist like we do, This product is a must have!!",1
"In response to the poster who asked about the dimensions, it's 24"" wide x 15"" high x 15"" deep (per description on the front of the box). The carry tote that fits inside is maybe 1/3 the size of that...I just received this yesterday from my registry, and I had picked it out online, so I was quite pleased at the size. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is quite smelly when you first take it out of the box, so it's ""airing out"" in our family room right now... I don't expect that it will continue to be a problem once it has gotten exposed to air circulation...I am giving it 4 stars for now just because of the smell... in case I have to clean it to get rid of the smell. Otherwise, looks like it would be 5 stars (although, as I said, I haven't used it yet).",0
"Overall, I have been very pleased with this soap. It is a pleasant alternative to harsher Dial or Old Spice body wash. The price is a bit high with shipping costs but I see few alternative at local stores. Olive oil has known anti-inflammatory properties but it probably unlikely that small amounts would be absorbed transdermally. The smell is great, so even if there are no medicinal benefits, I will be a repeat customer.",1
"I bought six pairs of these when I started training my son at 18mths. Now at 26 months, he wants to still wear these over his character underpants. They are super soft and have no nasty chemicals in the material, just pure 100% egyptian cotton. They are not waterproof but do hold a fair amount. I thought that was a bonus as my son trained quicker because he knew when he was about to or started to pee. Super soft, and does nor shrink up in washer and dryer. Great for sensitive skined toddlers. Fair trade and made in Egypt.",1
"I bought this particular stroller because of it's name (thinking quality), because it is so light weight, and lastly because of the snack trays(it's hard to find a light-weight double with snack trays). However, it is so not worth it. It digs in whenever I am pushing it due to the weight??? or poor design, but it also slides around and kills my back because I can't get the wheels to go where I am headed as they are constantly spinning. The snack tray is a joke because you can't even fit a cup in in. The shades about don't cover anything and the kids are constantly in the sun. On the plus side, the bottom has room for my purse and it's only 14 lbs so it is easy and small to get in and out of my Toyota Corolla.",0
"Seriously, these things were a waste of money. They don't stay on the window, and when they do, the sun stills shines on my baby's face... until they sling off the window and whack him in the head. Yikes.... please save your money and look for something else. These are crap.",0
"I had received this at my baby shower. She is now almost 4 months, the only thing she really likes is the blinking lights, but only for a few minutes. The mirror is a joke, she has alot more fun when I'm holding her looking in the bathroom mirror. Every baby is different on what they like to look at and play with. Now I think it's really cool, if I were her age, I'd love it, but oh well:o(",1
My one year old had no trouble figuring it out. It's neither sturdy nor intelligent in its design. I could not recommend it for the purpose it's being sold.,0
"It's nice that it folds all the way down for a newborn. That is why I bought it. The material is snazzy too. I like the all weather muff and the way you can switch the bar to go from front to back. However, BEFORE you buy it WALK AROUND THE STORE SEVERAL TIMES. The design of this thing is lousey. You will, (unless you have a really short step) hit your shins on the bottom of this stroller. It seemed fine in the store. Maybe because I wasn't walking the way I usually do. But after I riped all the tags off and brought it to the boardwalk I realized how uncomfortable it is to walk with. I am not very tall, nor do I have exceptionally long legs. I was very unhappy. I will not use it again. I've had other people try it of various hieghts and they all agree. SO TRY IT FIRST or you'll be stuck with it like I am. I now have a [$$$] clothes tree.",0
I found this monitor useless. The static was so loud on one channel that I couldn't sleep. The other channel picks up a radio station clear as day but not my baby crying. It is going right back to the store!,0
This gate was purchased so that my other children could easily swing it open and closed. It worked well for about 2 months and now the hinges have broken in half and I have to pressure mount it. Note: I HAVE TO PRESSURE MOUNT IT! My 5 year old is constantly needing to be let in or out so I am up and down. If I wanted to use a pressure mounted gate I could have spent $10.00 on a wooden one and at least you don't have to spend 2 hours trying to get those tight enough.,0
"This bag is super sweet and girly! I ordered this because my sister in law went thru several diaper bags with her first kid, so with her second kid ( a girl) she spent a little more on a Kalencom and has had it for 2 years and its still in perfect condtition! She swears by it and says its totally worth the money! I couldnt agree more! Its definately worth the money and amazon was a great choice because i found it cheaper then most other sites ;)The ONLY thing im worried about is it wont be big enough..but Im a first time mom and iv heard we over prepare :)",1
Got this product a year ago and gave to our Son and Wife for there new Baby. It has proven to be very sturdy and well made. At first it was just a place to sleep but now its a play pen also. He loves it and we love it. Likeed enough to by a secound one for when they visit us. Great product.,1
"I got this set to travel with and for daycare and I like it. The lids snap on the containers well. The only negative I've found is that the lids of the cups are not spill proof and they leak/drip a little. However, my son still likes them but sometimes the flow rate is a little quick for him since the milk comes out even when he isn't sucking.",0
The sling was not very easy to use and never seemed to reall work right,0
It seemed to be fine until my baby started on solid food. She's now 7 months and the odor is unbearable. Most of the positive reviews were written by people with babies less than 6 months. I moved it from the nursery to a bathroom and every time I walked into the bathroom I could smell it pretty badly. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.,0
This is a must have item for BOB owners in summer. We live in CA and have endless sunshine and those annoying Santa Ana winds. This is great for blocking out winds and flying bugs too. It stops my boy from getting over excited and throwing his toys out where we may be.Very easy to put on (if I can do it you can too!!)As usual with BOB goodies it is very high quality.,1
"great lunch bag! the material is great, waterproof, looks good, goes through the wash great! Had it monagramed for a friend and looks fabulous!",1
I have been using Pampers since my 7 month old baby was born. I have never had any issues with leaks.,1
"I used these with my 2.5 year old, in combination with the Dora potty. She gets a star each time she does each of the tasks ( pulling off/on undies, sitting on potty, peeing in it, flushing toilet, and washing hands). She is completely on board with it. I also am bribing her a little because if she gets all the stickers on the chart she gets a Dora backpack ( that is within view of the potty). The stickers aren't all that exciting, but she loves the characters, so no complaints!",1
"Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing.",0
"This sleeper did its job very well. Having our daughter in the bed with us made it much easier for me to nurse during the night (especially while recovering from a C-section!), and this sleeper gave her the safe place she needed. We were not worried about rolling over on her, and the little light it has came in handy during the night. I was able to fold up this little bed and put it in my suitcase for travel.If I were making another one, I would either make it longer or have the bottom part detachable so it could last longer, though I suppose at some point she had to go in her crib...",1
"Bought the PRI based on great reviews and price. It arrived very quickly (next day, using Amazon Prime). Ufortunately, it doest fit in my standard kitchen sink or bathroom vanities. In fact, the PRI does not even come close to fitting. I wouldnt recommend this for bathing in standard sinks. However, I plan to use it in the bathtub to bathe my newborn alongside my 2 year old. I like that it is shaped in a way that will keep the baby from slipping and I think it will be fine for bathing the 2 kids together, though my 2 year old will have to get used to bathing in shallower water since the PRI sits very low!",0
"This is a really great product... With just a little bit of water it sterilize everything really fast and it turn off by itself...And it's big enought to put almost everything you want to... I really prefer this one instead of the microwave one because the other one is smaller, what means that you have to spend more electricity because you have to sterilize more times!!! And not even try to boil the bottles in the stove .... believe me, you would forget to turn it off... That has happend to me a thousand times in my mother's house!!",1
"From the reviews, I thought this pad was a winner. But after one wash, the edge of the quilted padding attached to the elastic siding ripped. This left about a one foot tear. Fluke or quality control issue? I don't know. Needless to say, I am returning it.",0
"I purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus back in September based on reviews and good pricing (online at Target for only $29.99), unfortunately this pail did not live up to expectations. Once arrived I used the pail for all sorts of diaper disasters (#1 and #2) and immediately I noticed the horrible smell that wafted from the Diaper Dekor Plus. Resigned, I began using only for #1 diapers, hoping this would cut down on the smell. However, this was not the case. I don't even have to be in the same room as the diaper pail to smell the pungent odor. I've finally given up on the Diaper Dekor system and hope that after a month outside, empty, I might be able to use this thing as a stupidly expensive trash can for office trash.",0
"These wipes are terrible! I usually buy wipes from Target but thought that I'd try these out since they were a comparable price. What a disappointment! The wipes are tiny, the sticker that covers the hole to get the wipes out of the bag is virtually impossible to peel off in any fashion that would allow you to reseal it, they are not very moist and worst of all they smell terrible!!! My 15 month old son makes a 'stinky face' every time I try to get them anywhere near him. I figured I'd just use them to wipe down counters and what not since I can't bear to use them while changing his diaper but the smell is so bad that I just decided to throw them away! I'll go to the big box store and buy their up and up brand from now on.",0
"I took a chance on saving with this 9.99 diaper pail....it is amazing, we had our changing table in our bedroom for a while when our son was first born and I have NEVER ONCE smelled his dirty diapers, and he is a breat fed baby so they are QUITE stinky. I just use VERY CHEAP vanilla scented bags and even when I take it out I smell the vanilla first. What a relief to be able to save a little money!",1
"The Diaper Champ worked great for about the first eight months. After that, it started to loose it's ability to contain the stink. We have resorted to placing the Diaper Champ on the back patio. I hope it doesn't attract any wildlife!",0
"In the past, I rated a diaper pail that required expensive refills. In the review I stated to go for a pail where you can use your own bags...that's what had done. All was well for a couple of months. Our diaper changing area was on the first floor in the laundry room. We put a changing pad on top of the dryer so we wouldn't have to run upstairs all the time to change diapers (we had 2 children in diapers at the same time)...well soon we started to notice an odor and it didn't go away. We came to realize that the pail itself was absorbing the odors and we could not get rid of the stench no matter how much we washed it. Now we just use an ittby bitty garbage can that holds about 5 diapers and we empty it out every day...that's the only way to keep the diaper smell out of the house.",0
"Pluses - lightweight, easy to store, and looks really nice. Super comfortable for my baby, and adjusts to both ""mom facing"" and forward facing. For smaller babies, can be made to lie flat and with the boot, is almost bassinet-like.Minuses - sometimes hard to open from the stored position, and the basket on the bottom is SUPER TINY.",1
"I have had this stroller for about a year now. My daugher and I both love it. We use it almost every day and have had no problems. I mostly walk, but have done some jogging. The only problem I have is the front tire does jiggle some when I am jogging even when it is locked in place. It isn't bad, but it makes the stroller shake a little. Other than that I love it.",1
"Just what I was looking for. Fabric is of decent quality. The colors in display are very true to color in person, which is great. Look forward to using this in our first grandchild's crib. Thanks",1
This is perfect for fall and spring! We have the fuzzy one for winter too....I LOVE THIS!THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!,1
"We first look for a stroller that is not too cheap or too expensive, and we came across Peg Perego, and its Made in Italy, which I thought it can't be that bad... We bought this stroller before our son was born.First of all, we had a Graco infant car seat; the Peg Perego do not have any sort of attachment to put the Graco car seat on the stroller, it basically just tap on with a so called seat belt that is not tight and not secue; if you are on a flat surface walking, its ok, but certainly not safe!The seat belt on the stroller was the stupidest design there is! Because the backing of the seat is soft, the seat belt is not stationed, so everytime we try to buckle up our son, he just doesn't seem like he is secure on the seat; sometimes i figure why bother strap him in?This Pliko P3 only faces outward, so my son couldn't see me and felt very unsecure. With any new parents, i would definitely recommend a stroller that can both face you and face out.The seat is very square and roomy, so when my son sat in there, he wabbles, and he hated it because is not snugged. We tried and tried till he was 10 months old and he still hated his stroller. It made my life miserable because since he won't seat in it, i can't really go out to do shopping with him or stroll him around the park.We end up buying another stroller and wee settled with a Bugaboo, even though it was more expensive, but my son loves it and its worth every penny (or dollar!) ;) I really wish we bought the Bugaboo in the beginning.",0
"This is a nice seat -- so comfy my 18-mo-old can use and stable enough that the 3yo also loves it. The handles offer added security for early potty use. We bought two of these to have on eat each toilet. However, the less-used one recently split at the seams! Sadly it's past the return date.The two-piece design is terrific for trapping urine in the little grooves and also the cushy ring often slips off when this is hung up in the bathroom since you have to hang it by one of the little handles.My parents bought theMommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seatand I think it's much comfier, much easier to clean AND it's only $10. Oh, and it also has a hook that makes it super easy for the child to hang it up after use. I'd recommend that one instead.",1
"We bought the new version of the diaper genie when our son was born. He is 19 months old, and we still use it, and still love it. There is some odor when you empty the pail, but we have found that if you spray some Lysol into the bottom of the pail before you close it, this helps neutralize any leftover odors. You MUST use the correct liners for the odor-blocking to work. As soon as your baby takes anything besides breast milk, change to the Stage 2 (toddler) liners. This includes formula, as formula poops smell stronger than breast milk ones. Also, for those who complain that the genie doesn't hold enough diapers, try this: for urine only diapers (i.e., no poop!), simply throw them away in a regular garbage can. We have found that because our son is so hydrated, these diapers do not smell at all, and this way they don't take up precious room in the genie. We empty the genie once a week, just before trash day, and have no problems with odor. It also took us some time to figure out how the system works (with much puzzled head scratching!), but once you get it, it's easy. Unlike some other systems, our curious and enterprising toddler cannot get into the diaper genie. That alone makes any hassle worth it for us. Hope this helps!",1
"My wife and I were a little concerned about buying a piece of furniture online and never really seeing it in person, but the good reviews made us take the leap. We are happy to say it worked out great. It is exactly what we wanted for our nursery. The item showed up without any damage (which is a good testament to the packaging). FULL ASSEMBLY REQUIRED. We highly recommend having a 2nd person to help with reading instructions and holding items to put things together. It took us about 45-1hr to put it all together start to finish. Read instructions closely and take your time. Good build quality, drawers open smooth, changing pillow fits perfectly on top. We couldn't be happier for the price. Would definitely recommend!",1
"my baby is six months, and 22lbs, this sling is such a help with out it i wouldn't be able to carry him everywhere with me! he loves being carried in it.",1
"Although I am happy with my Graco playard, I am quite disappointed in the sheets. They are exceedingly thin and rough. Washing them only seemed to wear the fabric not make it softer. I would invest in another brand.",0
My 8 and 10 year old used this tonight and all of us experienced a bitter taste in our mouths and throat along with constant coughing by my asthmatic daughter. I just stepped in to check on my 10 year old who used 2 tablets in a full tub of warm water and left with a headache and nauseating feeling. I can't wait to hear what the company's feedback will be.,0
"Not a soft material, very yucky feeling.. kind of cheaply made, no elastic, which is good if you do not use it much since it will not dry out.. but with the material the way it is, I would go with a different brand sheet",0
"The only reason I bought this one for $60+ versus a comparable exersaucer for around $25 was because of the music - the ""12 songs plus flashing lights"". Well, there's just one little toy that has the lights and music. The batteries ran out in about 1 month, and the problem is, you can't replace the batteries (not easily). I'm mechanically inclined, so I opened up the toy, found it takes 3 little LR44 ""button"" batteries, but they're on a circuit board with tiny, brittle, poorly soldered wires. I removed the batteries carefully, and replaced them with 3 new batteries (which cost $12 by the way). The toy still wouldn't work (and yes, I put them in correctly). Now this exersaucer cost me $72+, and has no music or lights at all. The rest of the toys on it are just junk that our daughter could care less about. Don't waste your money - just buy a cheaper model.",0
"I used this pump for about two months off and on. It was working okay. It took me one half to one hour to pump about 4 ounces. It also had a few problems with the milk dropping into the bottle. These were not major problems at the time. Then, just when I needed it to pump exclusively it died. It acted like it was trying to work but had virtually no suction. No matter what we did, we could not get it working again. I would not suggest buying this pump!!!",0
"I have twins and this diaper bag even works for me... I'll probably have my HUGE diaper bag for a little while, but this is the perfect run to the store, go to the museum, go to the neighbor's house bag.If you're looking to hold a few diapers, wipes, change of clothes, trash bags, hand sanitizer, binky, cell phone and wallet... this is for you.",1
"I have three daughters....10, 7, &amp;amp; 4 months. I used the original Playtex bottles with my older daughters and they were great. Even when I would get tired of buying the liners and would try other reusable bottles...I would always go back to the Playtex. During this last pregnancy..I couldn't wait to try the Playtex Premiums!!! My baby is on Nutramigen and her pediatrician requests the powder because it is easier to digest; she also has reflux and he suggested these bottles to help her with that problem. She VERY RARELY spits up. On the reusable bottles, it left a film and they were hard to clean. I really wanted to use the VentAire Natural Shapes, but she would still spit up. These are so easy for me! I am a full time legal assistant to a Judge, have 2 very active older daughters, and a husband that is back in college &amp; works fulltime.....therefore, time is of the essence!!! Scrubbing bottles is the last thing I need each night!! I HIGHLY recommend these bottles for their convenience. Also, on the leaking liners...everynow and then I have one to leak..but if the top is on tight and you push the air out gently....the liners are great! THANK YOU PLAYTEX!!!!",1
"I am the mother of three young boys (the oldest is 3) and have 2 of the Alpha Omega carseats. The car seat is a nighmare, the straps twist and it is nearly impossible to get the children in tightly. I have to pull it apart at least once a month to untangle the straps. I have even tried ironing them but nothing works. I know at least 5 other moms with the same seat that have the exact problem. Save yourself headaches and buy another seat with thicker straps that don't twist so much.I hate these seats so much I am actually buying new ones for my youngest two because I can't imagine dealing with this for 3 more years.",0
My little baby loves this item. I suggest freezing and letting them go to town on it. Seems that she gets instant relief from teething and surgical-grade silicone holds up well.,1
I bought this mattress for a mini crib and it ripped at the seam the first day. It isn't very firm and it is very thin. It is a poor quality product that isn't worth the money.,0
"The material and color has held up over a year of use with multiple washes. The color is exactly as shown. Great product, highly recomend.",1
"I love the Avent bottles. My son (3 months) is exclusively breast fed, and he takes these bottles, and switches from breast to bottle with no problem. They're easy to clean with the wide tops. However, he outgrew the 4 ounces bottles pretty quickly - about 2 or 2 1/2 months. I would recommend getting the 9 ounce bottles and not filling it all the way. You're going to end up buying more bottles anyway.",1
"This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me. The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter. I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers? Hello? Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed. What about those holes? It is cute that the manual says ""do not drill through the door,"" hugh? Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors? Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill? Who pays for that? I know the answer to that one -> ME! Soooo....product is going back. Non-starter",0
"I had high hopes that this belt would help with back discomfort, but it hasn't. I think these must be for very specific types of problems. I am only 32 weeks pregnant, so it may prove more useful later. My advice is to not have very high hopes about this helping significantly--it is not very expensive, so it may be worth a try for you.",1
"I am surprised Graco would sell a product as cheaply made as this, but I guess for the $60-$70 mark, they didn't feel like putting much into their product. I ordered this through Amazon for my daughter, then once assembled noticed all the flaws and quickly returned it.1. It is a 3-point harness instead of a 5-point harness. After looking at the LiteRider in ""Pippin"" in person at BRU, I assumed all LiteRiders would have 5-point harnesses, but that proved to be false.2. The child's tray doesn't hinge so if you have a squirmy baby, it's not that easy to put them in or take them out of the seat since you would have to wriggle them in behind the tray or remove tray, put in/take out baby, then replace tray. Also, the way the stroller collapses to the ground when folding it up, the tray bangs against the ground unless you're careful to hold the stroller upright while closing it.3. The parent's tray is only screwed in on the bottom so the top can flip up and forward. I can imagine accidentally knocking this and spilling something onto the sunshade.4. The sunshade is very shallow and doesn't seem like it would block much sun from baby's face.5. The seat is very shallow and the seat back is low. Doesn't seem like it would be very comfortable as baby grows bigger.6. The fabric is cheap, scratchy and doesn't seem like it would be comfy against baby's skin. It reminds of of backpack material.I love Graco, but do not love this stroller. The only pro's are that it's lightweight and steers well, but other than that, it's got nothing going for it. We just ordered the Graco Alano stroller in Ally, which looks more like the MetroLite we used to have for our son, which was an awesome stroller. Will write my review for that once received.",0
"This stroller is rather difficult to manuever when your baby is more than 15 lbs. or so. Now that my baby is 2 (and not very heavy at all), It feels like I have to force the stroller into turns (no, the wheels are not locked :-)) and the stroller seems to be creaky. My sister has the same experience. Rather disappointed, I don't recommend this stroller for this reason.",0
"Anyone else who has written a good review of this product must be working for the company. many ill conceived design issues and some truely fatal flaws.1st: one unit can't monitor two rooms at the same time each unit has to be switched back and forth to each base station. you might as well buy two safety 1st at 19.99 because at night you need both monitors in your room anyway (for two kids) and getting on to the safety 1st- at least they work.2nd: BEEPS pretty much nonstop. Apparently it looses contact with the base station (according to the red light on it) this seems to happen every few minutes.3rd: range is awful says 2000ft- no way. In our medium sized house, won't reach from 1st bedroom to kitchen. maybe-80ft? OH, and of course, it beeps constantly when it cant achieve any signal or connection. Tried resetting, called the manufacture- we apparently have too much ""wood"" in our house.4th- battery life- 4hrs brand new, 1 hr in about a week.THis was designed by people who don't have two kids, don't need to sleep and enjoy low pitched beeps every 2 secs as a background soundtrack in their life- if this is you, then this product is definitely for you",0
"I really love this product. It makes it so easy to take my 1 year old son back and forth to daycare especially in the mornings when it is so cold, since I use an infant carrier for my car seat. I don't have to wrestle him into a coat or snow suit - All I have to do is put a hat on him and zip up, and he never gets exposed to the cold. It's also great when he falls asleep in the car - When I get inside, I can gently take him out and put him in his crib without waking him by taking off layers of clothing. I also like that I can easily unzip it in the car or in a store if it gets too warm so he doesn't overheat.",1
"First the pros:1. The range on this monitor is fabulous. We can pick up the sound from five houses away, down a city block. All I really wanted to do was get a good signal deep in the backyard; this monitor has made it possible to take my toddler outside while the baby sleeps in his crib.2. I really like the graduated lights - green, yellow and red. If there is some background noise in your room and you're not sure what you heard, the progressive lights help to confirm activity.3. I LOVE the portability! When packing up baby to go to a friends' house, there is no need to bring any power supplies!4. The manufacturer has great service.Now the bad: It's true...this monitor stinks, mechanically.1. Upon opening the box, the parent unit picked up no sound, and the charging stand for the child unit did not light up, giving me no assurance that the child unit was being powered by the power supply. A call to the manufacturer resulted in no-fuss delivery of new parts.2. Now, 6 months later, one of the child unit channels has gone defunct. There are two channels, and we're using the only remaining channel. Not comforting. I will call the manufacturer again, not sure what the warranty is.Even if they do replace the latest part that has malfunctioned, it's hard for me to recommend this monitor despite the pluses. However, I hope they keep sending me replacement parts, because I really like the features of this monitor!",0
"I looked at tons of other seats before deciding to purchase this one. It's supposed to be one of the safest infant seats out there. I agree with the others who say it's a bit heavy, but I don't carry it as a baby basket, so I don't mind it if that means it's well constructed. I can lift it just fine when I need to put it on a supermarket cart or onto the stroller or for the trip from the car to the house. It has a headrest that's removable, which was great while my son was tiny and didn't have the neck strength. Now that he's five months old I took it off since it seemed to just restrict him. The straps are easily adjustable, the fabric is nice, the color is beautiful, and it fits onto our BOB jogging stroller which is a plus for me. I'm very satisfied with this carseat.",1
The giraffe is so cute and my daughter loves it!!! We bought the whale also but the giraffe is her favorite.,1
I bought this swing for my daughter's new baby boy because it had several features that were neat such as the music along with the vibrating swing. Also the swing seat could detach and you could bring it anywhere. Unfortuately the swing itself won't stay swinging and that is quite a disappointment since I paid so much for this swing to do just that. I can't seem to get a hold of Amazon so that I can tell them that this swing is defective and am trying to get ahold of the vendor themselves. I am becoming pretty disgruntled because now several items I have bought from Amazon have been defective and they are not user friendly to contact.,0
I decided to try these bottles since they are BPA free and supposedly work like the Vent aire bottles. At first I thought they would be just fine but we experienced extreme fussiness and I was able to deduce that they made my son very unhappy. I'm not sure what the problem was he liked the nipples but for some reason every time I had him use those bottles he would get really upset afterwards.,0
I tried this pump when we had a power failure. I have a premie and getting breastmilk is crutial for her growth. This pump was of no help at all. It took 20 minutes per side to get a fraction of the milk. I was still full and used my medela pump to alliviate the engorgement that resulted. I decided to invest in the car adaptor as a backup to the Isis. Save youe money and invest in a better brand!,0
wonderful service...great product..I have no idea why it isn't available in stores...my grandson LOVES it!,1
The label states this product was tested for lead and BPA. Since there is no regulation for these things who knows how accurate this is. But the cups are well made and the colors are vibrant. cute simple toy.,1
"Don't buy this product!!! It is extremely painful to use this pump on a regular basis and can harm your breasts, trust me spend the extra money for a good pump!!",0
"I adopted a one year old small cat. Thought this gate would allow me to keep the garden door open to get fresh air, yet stop the small cat from jumping over it to to get out to the garden. Well, I was wrong!! The cat took one graceful jump over the gate to the garden and I had to run out to keep it from escaping. If you have a relatively fit cat, don't bother with this product. This gate is no higher than a kitchen counter. And we all know that cats jump up on counters all the time. I should have thought about that before I bought this gate. What a waste of $30 dollars.",0
"Last month I bought a Sit n' Stroll for traveling with our 18 month old. It appeared to be the perfect solution for taking taxis to and from the airport and getting around cities.Frustratingly, this is not the case. As you'll see below, the manufacturer's representative has even admitted in writing that they're receiving numerous complaints because the Sit 'n Stroll turns out to be incapable of handling either sidewalks or planes.In our case, it became almost inoperable after a single use. We closed it per the instructions and checked it at the plane's gate as you do with any stroller. Even though the wheels should be protected once folded into shipping position, they turn out to be so fragile that one of them was damaged while in the plane's hold. This made the Sit 'n Stroll VERY difficult to open and close and gave it terrible wobble when pushing it.When I contacted the company to arrange for a new wheel, I received an email saying wheels would not be available for 2 months due to an unexpectedly high number of customer complaints.Here's a word for word quote from the manufacturer's email: ""Unfortunately wheels are a hot commodity right now, people seem to be hitting a lot of curbs, potholes, and airline baggage handlers are just being extremely rough.""In other words, expect the Sit 'n Stroll to break if you bring it on a plane or push it down a normal city sidewalk.Even if the wheel hadn't broken, it is REALLY difficult to open and close the stroller as you have to lift it and your child into the air while simultaneously sliding down a bar. I consider myself to be strong, but it takes me and my husband to do it.",0
"No matter what I do, this thing still stinks. I prefer to take my daughters diapers out to the garage trash every other day or so. Don't waste your money!",0
"I had the organizer all set up and stocked with diapers and wipes. Everything was blissfull for the first few days of diapering. Then the honeymoon was over. I went to pull a NEWBORN diaper out and the flimsy zipper broke. It would probably work better if there were a zipper on each side for easier loading. My changing table dresser combo unit obviously does not hold the unit as it needs to hang in order to fully function, so I hung it on the side of the crib. Not a good idea. They make the hangers so large that you need to use the plastic pieces to hold it up. They fell into the crib (luckily when my son was not in it). As the stack of diapers goes down, the organizer collapses and eventually the diapers fall out. The organizer is useless in every way except wasting my time and energy. The wipe warmer works alright. It does warm them however, if you put too many in you will have quite a few burnt ones at the bottom. If you dont put enough they will dry out really quick. I have yet to use every wipe that I put in the warmer at a time. I only change it because the wipes are burnt or dry. I hate having a warmer and having to change my son with cold wipes because the wipes went bad. One revier I read a while back said to just turn it off every now and then, that is great if you leave your house for a while and dont need it. All that saved was electricity. All the wipes were dry when I returned. However if you are like me and deem it absolutely necessary to wave warm wipes, be prepared to throw out plenty of wipes. My son is now 2 and 1/2 months old and I think I have thrown out close to 250 wipes already. I gave it one star for warming the wipes.",0
"Our newborn needed to be swaddled in order to sleep, so we tried a variety of brands. We found this one to be the worst for us. We tried using it from the time our son was just born (8 lbs) to 2 months old and it never fit. Although the package says birth +, it was always too big for him. The velcro pad is located in the wrong place and could not get a tight fit for a swaddle. I was extremely disappointed as it is wonderful, light material and has the directions cleverly printed on the inner pocket. However, due to the poor fit, we were unable to use any of them.",0
"Subtitle: Taking Money From Excited Parents-To-BeMy wife and I bought this product early in the pregnancy. We took it home and tried it and didn't hear anything. But we chalked that up to it being too early.We broke it out again at around 25 weeks. Nothing. But it was still pretty early.26, 27, 28, 29 weeks. Nothing.Then at 30 weeks.... More nothing.We tried this all the way up to delivery (37.5 weeks for us) and we could never be sure that what we were hearing was the result of our baby moving as opposed to the mic just picking up every micro-movement.The problem is that this is just a cheap condenser microphone that is held up to the woman's belly. Holding it by hand definitely won't work - you can't hold your hand still enough to prevent the microphone from picking up small vibrations.But we also tried this with the included elastic strap while my wife was lying down in a quiet room with both the ceiling fan and even the AC turned off.Sure, we heard.... something.And, at the time, we really, really, REALLY wanted to believe that what we heard was our baby. But in the end I'm afraid that most, if not all, of what we heard was just very small movements of my wife's belly.If you've ever used an acoustic stethoscope, this product sounds similar to what you hear when handling the tubes leading from the diaphragm/bell to the earpieces. Kind of a ""pfff pfff *thump* pfff"".The following is from the (current as of this posting) Wikipedia article on electronic stethoscopes: ""The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor."" That is the technology used in this product.In summary, if we had it to do over again, we would rent/buy a dopler microphone or just go without.",0
We have several different brands we use (helps fill in when she's in between sizes) and the bummis are definitely one we'll stick with. They fit my baby's fat thighs and (usually) keep the big poops in. They also bleach better when we need to run a bleach load to spruce things up a bit.,1

"Does what they're advertised to do. A bit difficult to get out of the socket when you need to, but this has a dual purpose in also being difficult for your child to pull out.I'm a single dad, so don't have the nails that would be needed - so I often have to use a knife or the prong on whatever Im trying to plug in to get these out of the socket",0
"I'm so grateful that Seventh generation makes this wipe. There is no offensive perfume smell, no harmful ingredients. Love the price on Amazon!",1

HOWEVER, these are called ""snug & dry""..... Prior to these I have been using Pampers cruisers(I was very happy with those), the only reason I changed is because the price went up and, like a fool I was trying to save a few dollars. These don't keep my little girl dry at all. They smell and I'm very disappointed. I wish I would've just stayed with the cruisers.",0
SO far I am 24 weeks and I haven't heard a peep with this monitor and honestly I can barely hear my own heart beat when I hold it up to my left chest area. The only sounds I can hear are some minor whooshing sounds which could be anything.,0

I bought this product for my infant and when I went to the fire station to have the seat installed (with the bundle me in it) the fireman told me that this product should not be used! He explained that it interferred with the harness and if we were in a crash the baby could come flying out or have serious injuries!! I wouldn't recommend it but I would recommend the shower-cap style covers that don't go behind the baby but just over the outside of the infant seat.,0
Fantastic product highly recommend word of advice though - do NOT order from TARGET online they take forever to ship and lie to you when you get through their crap telephone auto attendant system.,0
I received this item as a shower gift. When I went to use it we got nothing but static. I ended up returning it to babies r us and exchanging it for the Sony 27 channel model.,0
"My wife and I like to travel and we have discovered that having the Baby Bjorn has made traveling light very easy - a point driven home last month when we did a nine day trip to Venice and Paris. We saw countless other parents struggling to tote strollers up and down over the various canal bridges in Venice, while we simply walked up and over the bridges with my kid sitting on my chest. We didn't use the stroller one time the entire nine days we were abroad, even though we spent 8-12 hour stretches out and about almost every single day.We would generally keep our daughter facing out (so she could ""sightsee"" with us), and then when she got tired and wanted to sleep, we turned her in facing me so that she could sleep against my shoulder (or in some cases, we'd just find a nice shady place in a park to sprawl and nap). Otherwise, the only other items I ever had to carry were two to three diapers, a sandwich bag with a few wipes, a sippy cup (all of which fit into my pockets) and my daughter's jacket, which I could roll up and tuck behind the front straps of the carrier. My wife never had to carry anything, and when she's happy, we're all happy! The Baby Bjorn was also extremely useful during the plane flight home; our kid wouldn't sleep in the bulkhead bassinet that the airline provided, but she did great when in the Baby Bjorn. I ended up ""wearing"" her for six of the nine hours flying home with little trouble.The Baby Bjorn also works well when you want to take your family to sporting events. Our kid's already been to more than a dozen NBA and major league baseball games - in every instance, she always has a front row seat on my chest. These kinds of family nights out wouldn't be possible with a stroller, but since I'm carrying both the kid and everything she might need on me, my wife is finding that she really likes live sports a lot more than she thought she did.While a lot of folks talk about how the Baby Bjorn keeps your hands free, I think it's real value lies in the extra mobility it affords and in the extra bonding time it gives the parent carrying the baby with the baby itself. . . and it makes a great eye shade when you want to lie down and nap. I'll be really sorry when our kid gets to be over 25 lbs (probably by the fall) and we can't use this thing any longer.",1
"When I bought this swing, I incorrectly assumed that because it was made by a major name brand it must be safe. WRONG! At about 5 months, my daughter learned grab hold of the bars on the side of swing. When she did this, the seat somehow folded up, and she was hanging upside down from it with her head dangling about an inch from the floor! My husband said from the start that the design was poor. I wish I'd listened to him. Don't buy this swing! Also, avoid swings that hang from doorways. They can be unstable too, and your baby can drop to the floor!",0
"I bought these seat protectors for my leather seats hoping that they'd help protect them from my 3yr old who's constantly kicking the seat. My biggest peeve with them is that you have to stick the velcro onto the back of your seat. I didn't just pay all this money for leather only to stick stickers all over the seats, not knowing if the glue will ever come off.(ie like a price tag) I guess that may have been my own fault. Had I researched a little more, I'd have seen that. Anyhow, mine just kinda 'hang' there. The good news is, my seat is protected from her shoes.",0
"This is a nice stroller! It feels like a steal for the price I paid! It has been five years since we have owned a double stroller and boy have they improved over the years!My 20 month old just loves it! There is lots and lots of room when it come to the basket underneath. We have a two week old and he snuggles in fine. I found all buckles are easy to use. For a double stroller it handels nice, steering a bit tight, but its a joy to have.lol We might even have to give it name! Buy this stroller and you will be just a thrilled!Melissa in Bradenton FL",1
My baby loves to bounce - and this is a great bouncy seat - doesn't have too many bells and whistles and the toy bar comes off if you don't want to use it.

"The animal is great, the shape is nice - his head 'hangs' over a childs shoulder but the sounds that come with this thing are simply scary for young kids.

"I installed this on our pantry door over a year ago using the adhesive that came with it. My almost 2.5 year old still has not defeated it and it is still stuck firmly to the door despite opening and closing the door numerous times each day. I actually came here to buy another one to use on our front door now that my daughter has learned how to unlock outside doors. I was very surprised to see so many negative reviews. We have other child locks on other doors and they don't work as well as this one. I do have to be careful to make sure the lock re-engages when I close the door and my daughter rarely hangs on this door handle, but it has never failed us yet.Update: We've had this installed for about 2 years now and we've had no problems with them. They are still firmly attached to the doors and work well. My now 4.5 year old can open these easily but they are still great for keeping my almost 2 year old contained. It is funny, they seem to be adult-proof, though. Most adults who visit us struggle to figure these out!",0
"I was told by friends how WONDERFUL the Boppy was, and also registered for it due to the number of rave reviews. However, I took it to the hospital with me and found that it is not as versatile as expected. It didn't fit around my waist, causing a huge crease in the middle. A friend suggested and actually sent me a &quot;My Brest Friend&quot;, which I thought would sit in the closet but it actually turned out better. It has an adjustable velcro belt, so even Daddy (who is pretty big) can use it for bottle feedings. As suggested by others, you should really try them out before you spend the money.",0
"Once my twins started sleeping through the night, they started getting intense diaper rashes despite our best efforts to avoid them. This cream saved us! It holds up all night. It is so thick, and the smell is nice too! Get this cream if you want to avoid rashes forever.",1
"This product is very good. Also, battery life is as advertised (8h of battery life or a little bit more).",1
"Comfortable and easy to use for my infant. I even used it for my 6 year old who demanded to be carried when we were walking a long way one day. I like that it puts baby on the hip so I can have a free hand for cooking, whereas with a front carrier, baby would be too close to the stove.",1
"Instructions for installation are great and almost fail-safe.Super easy to latch/unlatch, or even remove.Looks decent - blends in with all types of decor.Is completely safe! My infant who just learned to crawl/pull up is totally secure, but the true test is my two little nephews (1 1/2 year old boys). They (together!) rattled this gate with all their might like they were trying to escape from jail, and the gate didn't budge. No damage to the walls, gate, or most of all, them!",1
"Great Diapers.As of December 2004--Shipping is no longer a problem. Ships out within a couple of days, and received with in ten. Free shipping. Gotta love that.Give 5 stars, but unable to edit the stars--only the review.",1
"I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant. I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work! I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in. I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on. I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction! I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on. I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me! I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it. A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare.",0
"This product is OK but not worth the extra few dollars for the wipes/diaper pouch. Newborn diapers barely fit in the pouch, meaning extremely limited use as the baby grows. I would instead buy the changing kit without the pouches for the money (I suppose you can put diaper ointment, etc, in the pouches, but it seems to me like they just will get in the way).",0
"I had to turn in my hospital pump and started using a store-bought electric pump. I cried at how inefficient it was. I started reading reviews on manual pumps and ran into this one. When I used it I could not believe I was getting more milk in less time than the electric pump. I can pump 3oz in about 5 minutes. HOWEVER, I did find that it works much better without the comfort seal. My nipple hurt a bit, but I got used to it. It does have a lot of parts to wash and can take long to air dry.",0
"This gym was given to us at a shower, and I was excited because I had read some good reviews...plus it was like $70.00 and no way would I have ever paid that! We started using it when my son was around 2 months old, and he had no interest in it. He'd look at the water box and lights for a few seconds, but it was hard to get it to play music(you had to literally slap it, and I think it should have easily came on when the gym jiggled) and the music was really low. We tried new batteries, which didn't help. The 3 toys it comes with are really uninteresting...one is a plastic fish that like Morgan's Mommy's review stated ""Resembled a dog toy."" The stuffed turtle did nothing, and the little plastic book wasn't very interesting since my son was 2 months old. The toys just hung there...and he was not happy at all. The flaps on the bottom of the mat might have been interesting later on, but there were 3 different languages on them and since my son can't it seemed a little pointless. I tried several times letting him play in this gym, since just because it seemed boring to me, didn't mean it was to him. But, at every attempt he laid there and looked and the gym for a couple of minutes, and then his attention would go to looking around the room, the tv, the dog, or other toys laying near.I took this gym back to Babies R Us, and it was on clearance for $40(not really surprising). I exchanged it for the Fisher Price Rainforest Gym, and my son loves everythig about it and so do I...and I totally recommend it!",0
"This has been the biggest aggravation. Other than it looking nice and having the Eddie Bauer name on it, I think it's crap. It's too wide getting it in and out of the car. The handle is not ergonomically shaped. And when carrying a baby around this needs to be comfortable. It's not easy to pinch the handle release and move it back or forward. The cover gets in the way when trying to put the handle back. It's extremely difficult to put the carseat in the base. Finding where it snaps in is an annoyance. I have to slide it back and forth to find where it goes. I have to press down on both sides for it to snap in. It doesn't just snap easily. When taking the seat out of the base, it doesn't just come out when you pull the release. I have to pull the release numerous times to finally get the sucker out. And in doing so it moves the base from it's secure position. The buckle is hard to snap. Even my husband has a hard time putting that puzzle piece buckle in the latch along with putting and taking the carseat in and out. When tightening or loosening the straps, using two hands you have to reach behind the carseat and pull or tighten each side. The cover is flimsy and two hands are needed to cover the child. It's not worth the money or time. I won't buy anything from Cosco again. I now use the Graco Quattro Tour Travel System and LOVE IT!!!!.",0
The fabric used for this blanket is not soft and cuddly like a baby blanket should be. The design is very nice but the quality leaves alot to be desired!,0
"Sometimes a simple single purpose gadget is the best way to go. The Itzbeen definitely fits into this category. When you are trying to feed, calm a fussy baby, the last thing on your mind is updating a log book or setting alarms for the next feeding. Just click the button and deal with the bookkeeping later, if you forget, the alarm will still remind you for the next feeding.As far as smartphone apps go, click, swipe to unlock, optional passcode, find the app, launch, wait and finally mark the event is too much for a sleep deprived parent to do with one hand while shushing a frantic baby.One small gripe:- Adjusting when the alarm goes off will reset the timer. So, if you decide to go 4 hours at night instead of 3 in the day, you have to go alarmless for an entire feeding cycle. Big bummer! Might be better if it left the timer alone when you press & hold to adjust the alarm.",0
"This is the best choice for a diaper pail on the market. As a mommy with an 11 year old, a 9 year old and twin 8 month old boys, we knew we needed a diaper pail that was not only easy to use, but actually worked at keeping the smell away and this was the best choice!We tried the diaper genie with our first two, but the fact that it was such a pain to use and actually did very little to keep the smell away, and didn't seem to hold half the number of diapers that we would be using on a weekly basis, we decided that the diaper genie was NOT the choice for our twins.After reading the reviews we chose this one and we are so glad we did! We have twin boys that are now 8 months old, so to cut down on spending money on refills we only use this diaper pail for dirty diapers and have a seperate trash can for wet diapers. We have only had to purchase one refill kit so far and this diaper pail holds a TON of diapers. I was concerned that as they got older and their diapers got bigger that we would have to empty a diaper pail constantly, but not this one!Also, if you're looking for something that is easy to use and actually contains the smell, this is it! You simply step on the lever with your foot and drop the diaper in! There are flaps that the diaper falls through as long as those flaps are closed and the lid shuts on top, there is never an odor issue!The refill is easy to install and the pail is very easy to empty, so easy that my 9 year old emptied it to help me out one afternoon and had absolutely no problem doing it!We highly recommend the Diaper Dekor Plus!",1
"Pampers appears to have two lines of diapers for small babies--Baby Dry, and Swaddlers. My wife and I had to buy Baby Dry in a pinch, and they weren't as good.The primary problem is that the waistband is not strechy AND the tabs have more adhesive than hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro(R)). Swaddlers just have the hook-and-loop. You need to adjust the tabs more precisely the first time because there's less forgiveness, and it's not as easy to reposition the tabs securely because the adhesive loses stickiness.Six thumbs down to Baby Dry. Stop those lines, and just make Swaddlers. That's my advice to Pampers.I give ""2 stars"" because the koala is cute, and the diapers are better than going without !!",0

"I bought this for my 4 yr old girl whose head always dropped to the side.When she falls asleep, she doesn't TRY TO HOLD this pillow to support her head because she IS SLEEPING! I always have to climb to the back seat and adjust it. She turns her head from right to left or the other way and I can't be right by her and switch pillow back and forth. (one side is high and the other is low)It has just a couple of sponges inside so for that I think its price is not right.I'm looking for something that goes behind her head and back and has support for both sides.",0
"This highchair is a nice compromise of size and function. It was pretty easy to set up and is easy to use. The only difficulty I had was in threading the shoulder straps through the buckles. That proved to be quite a bit harder than one would expect. It didn't take more than 5 or 10 min. at the most, but my hands were tired by the time I got done. The seat is very easy to clean. My son seems to like it and I like it, too.",1
"I love the regular take and toss cups, so I was excited when I saw these. I got the boy color four pack for my 2 year old son and at the first usage I realized that these were a bad idea! He can pull the straw out and then the liquid comes out, what is tee point of having a removable straw!? I'm going to try the straw cups with the twisty top instead, don't waste money on these...cheap as they may be!",0
I wish I hadn't ordered this online -- too much of a hassle to send back -- however the chemical smell is so strong after airing it out for two weeks that I don't want to put my baby's toys in it.,0
"We bought this little turtle about 6 months ago because we thought it would be fun for our 2 1/2 year old to look at the stars on the ceiling while falling asleep. Our son will absolutley NOT sleep without it now, so it has now become a night-time ritual to turn on ""stars"" before bed.We like that the ""stars"" are on a timer, so it doesn't eat up the batteries, and there are a couple different color options to rotate through. We've probably changed the batteries 2-3 times in the last 6 months, which is not bad considering our son asks for us to turn the ""stars"" back on periodically through the night.We also bought this turtle as a gift for another little boy, after our son decided he loved it so much...he too is addicted to the stars nightlight :)We would definitely recommend this turtle. Ours is the green turtle (which I personally like the look of best), and we gave this brownish one as a gift.",1
I love the stroller! However there are a few things that i Hate! I don't like that there isn't a way to keep it folded up. I also don't like that there isn't a place for the wheels after to fold the stroller up. Before i even got to use it i had to go fill the tires up.I really didn't like there directions they sent with it. I had to send for the owners manul and then they sent me photo copies. For being such a big company that has been around for so long you would think they would have an actual owners manul. What i love about it is how it rides on any surface. It is so easy to push and my kids love to be in it.It is a little bigger then i had expected.Good luck on deciding. there are so many to pick from.,0
"I originally had a Medela Swing, which was ok. It was my first pump, so I didn't know any better. But when we out of town, my pump stopped working because it shorted out (my dog had bitten thru the wire, and when my husband tried to re-connect the wires, it died). Anyway, I needed a pump badly, we went to Wal-Mart and bought this one because it was a cheap fix. When I first used it, it felt sort of violent at first because I was used to my Medela,which is very gentle. But it was only because I wasn't used to the Even Flo. Well, I was amazed at the amount of milk I got in such a short amount of time (a full 5 oz in maybe 10 minutes!!!but I was pretty engorged, too). I think it's much more efficient since there is no tubing, which can reduce the suction power. I havent had any problems with the pump at all, and am very happy with this purchase and price. The breast pads that came with it are terrible, though, and I stick to Lansinoh pads, which ROCK! They don't leak at all, even in the morning when I tend to be full. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is pretty loud, and the flanges only come in one size.",1
"When you can get this very tempermental pump to work, it works great. But I have had the same problem that others have reported; the little membrane/valve thing keeps popping off, thus causing the pump to lose all suction. I have to stop pumping and fish the thing out every 2-3 minutes. I can get just as much milk with this pump as I can with my Medela Pump in Style Advanced, but I don't like having to stop and unscrew it every few minutes. And according to the reviews, I am not the only one with this problem.",0
I am so happy with my purchase. This is so good. My baby sleeps so nicely on this crib. They send a card board with this mattress. Don't throw that. You can keep mattress on this cardboard int0 he crib.,1
"Hats off to the inventor of this product. I purchased one for my daughter about a month ago & LOVE it! Since then, we now have about 8 Snack Traps. I always pack a couple in the diaper bag any time I leave the house. I can't say enough good things about it. Now I don't worry about crumbs all in my car. My son who is 5 even loves using a Snack Trap. It is so cool. My friends all had to get some for their children.Great product, Thanks!",1
"again the color shown is blue,i ordered and i received a pink one.dissatisfied again because i have a boy.give customers the option to choose their color",0
"I bought this tub because I was really excited about the rinse/spa sprayer. But it really is a terrible product. The cover on the incline is impossible to get off and clean, it's ridiculous. And the sprayer got water in the battery case and it stopped working. We never took the top off once we put the batteries in; water just worked down into it and ruined it. The sprayer hose is so hard to uncoil you can't use the sprayer and hold onto your baby at the same time.I would never buy this product again. Just go with a basic tub you'll be happier.",0
"I don't have a problem with the bottle at all... but the nipple is terrible. It's flat and awkward and my 9-week old baby would give me a very strange look whenever I tried to feed him with it. Plus after only one use, the nipple broke! I got my money back, but I'll never get back the 10 minutes of my life I spent buying and returning these pieces of junk!!!!",0
My toddler has enjoyed using this potty so much. The little book it comes with is particularly helpful in showing her what to do. The splash guard also is a great feature. I am very pleased with this purchase.,1
"I purchased this as a gift for a baby shower. The mother-to-be was delighted to receive this item and several new mothers said this was a useful item, especially for working mothers who don't have much time available. The items arrived in excellent condition due to careful packaging by the company.",1
"I would highly recommend the Playtex bottles. I used them for both of my daughters 23 and 21 years ago. I loved them then and now I love using them for my grandaughter. When her parents first brought her home they were using the vent-aire bottles. They were told these would help with gas. Bottles and nipples were piling up waiting to be sterilized. I asked them why they weren't using the Playtex bottles and it was just a ""less gas"" image the other bottles claimed. I convinced them to try the Playtex, which also would have less gas with the liner and less clean up. They tried them and haven't used any other bottles since. The baby has had even less gas with the Playtex than the other bottles. She also did better with the Playtex nipple, the other bottle caused her to gag and she had trouble sucking with it. I know some of the reviews have claimed that is is difficult to mix the formula in the liner. We really haven't had any problems. We put the formua in the liner and add 6 ozs. of water, then the nipple and lid and shake away. We haven't had any leakage problems either. The new drop in liners are so much better that the old ones that you had to tear the sides off of. We do purchase Parent's Choice drop ins. They are alot cheaper and we haven't been able to tell the difference from the Playtex liners. The bottles were good 25 years ago and still going strong even with the updates.I hope this review is helpful to others wanting to use Playtex bottles.",1
"I purchased this for my 5 month old and he loves it. It's not too crazy with talking animals and flashy lights, but still entertaining enough to keep baby happy while I do little things around the house. It's not so easy to move to different rooms because of the size, it doesn't fit through doors unless you fold it. The music on it is really great and easy to dance to.",1
"After installing the product, I found a small slip of paper in the packaging informing me that the colors may bleed and damage my seats if the internal temperature of the car exceeds 100F. A car parked outside during the summer will most definetly exceed this temperature limit. What's the point of buying a seat protector if they are going to damage your seat?!!!",0
A friend recommended this product because it helped his baby sleep at night. It never worked for our daughter. She slips right off of it and ends up in a puddle at the bottom. I've arranged the foam positioners as tight as possible around her little body and even taken her arms out of the swaddle and put the positioners beneath her armpits - she still slides down. Save your money and use two rolled up receiving blankets like they do in the hospital.,0
"We purchased this for a babysitter's house and although it doesn't have as many bells and whistles as many other bouncers, it keeps our baby very occupied and happy. The plush headrest is very nice, especially for the baby's occasional bouncy seat naps. Simple assembly, good quality for the price. Highly recommended.",1
"The same 800 number the others called, then pressed 0. Very cool! Thanks for the suggestion!",1
Bought this for a child at daycare when we go to the beach would not fit on the picnic table I had to return it,0
this item has a short battery life. sometimes it will die during the night even if have charged it fully during the day.this system is prone to a lot of interferences.,0

"Bought this changing table when I was expecting my first son. It was easy to assemble, and has worked great. The design is good-and it is very durable. My son was and still is a big boy. We plan to still use with our next child. The whole set was a good buy at a good price. Definitely recommend.",1
"Product works well, does what it is supposed to. No complaints. Would recommend to anyone who needs to pump while out and not able to get an AC wall connection.",1
I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... Would not suggest.,0
"I purchased the Nature's Touch swing and it seemed really great, but the swing design is poor. The functionality is really wonderful being able to switch from cradle to swing, and the music options are really nice, but the bugs that circle the top can only be seen by the parent not the child in the swing; frustrating for a child, they see something turning but it is not the cute face that we see, only the bottoms of the bugs. Also, the mirrored globe presents a very distorted image for the baby. They need to further improve their design. I called Mattel and the customer rep was very apathetic and unhelpful. We love fisher Price, so this was a disappointment for us.",0
This gate is soooo awesome. I bought it today and didn't even need to look at the directions to install it. It was pretty self explanatory. It is in our bedroom doorway and I love that you can walk through without having to take the gate down completely.We also bought the First Years All Clear Swing Gate for the top of our staircase. It is also awesome! We did have to buy wall anchors because one side of our stairwell is drywall but that was no big deal.These two First Years gates are GREAT!!! I recommend them both.,1
"I've used this with my newborn now for about 5 weeks. After about 2 weeks, the mechanism that makes the bubbles move started making a terribly loud noise, like a grinding, so loud that you can't hear the music over it. I wish I could turn on the music without the bubbles, but all things are on one switch. Then I changed the batteries, and now the vibration for the seat is making a loud noise. Very frustrating. Ironically, my son actually does like the noises and vibrations, so I can't completely pan this bouncer, but being a work-at-home mom, I can't stand turning on the aquarium part. The harsh noise drives me nuts. If you read a cross-section of the reviews here, you can see that others have had this noise problem. I can't recommend this product.",0
"I returned this product after using it for 1 night in my 2-year old's room. I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the volume. I had it on the highest volume and I needed it to go up 1 or 2 more notches. If you want something that can block outdoor noises such as loud birds or trash trucks in the morning, or indoor noises such as siblings in the same room, then I don't recommend purchasing this product. On the plus side, the product is very light, would be easy to travel with, and has a large selection of sounds, if those features are important to you.",0
"While my son was an infant, the Champ was fine. Real food produces real smells and breast milk and formula did not. Now that he's a toddler, I have stopped using it because.... I am LAZY! I have NO TIME or PLACE to clean up the thing to make it stop smelling. This is one of the suggestions/rules of ANY diaper refuse product. To make it work well, buy THICK trash bags not generic brands. The thicker the bag, the less smell seeps out. I just put the Champ in the trash can.To me however, the Genie seems to offend less. For the past year I have had a used Diaper Genie and for my son's most offensive diapers, they go in there! It just finally broke and I'm online today to buy another Genie. Hope this recent mention helps.",0
My twins really like this booster. It is comfortable to sit on and it does not slide around on the chair. It is easy to clean and we can bring it with us when we go on vacation.,1
"Couldn't get the darn thing to work. What really sucks is that once you attach it, you can't move it around so you get only one try at the thing. I think I'll leave it up to the proffessionals from now on.",0
"Perfect size, easy to clean, very functional. We keep it in the car and use it whenever we go out to eat - like that it has its own tray so baby doesn't have to be scooted up to the table. This is a must-have!",1
"We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it. Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not. It had no handles then, and the pee guard stood up high and was removable. We never used the pee guard, it made it harder to get on the seat and it just wasn't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more (one shows way more interest than the other - it's the reluctant one I want to bribe) We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I'm willing to try anything at this point, within reason. (ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much, LOL, and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert)The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE. It's a very low pee guard. Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy, but it's there, and it's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it wasn't there. (One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem, but with this in the way, it would be) And it does not come off. I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow, maybe with a dremmel, but you shouldn't have to make modifications to a potty ring. It's one of the worst designs I can imagine. It's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder. So I decided to skip this. Even if we were to have marginal success with it, I am pregnant with another boy now, and I refuse to buy something I know he won't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son's potty ring when we lost it, but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item. No handles made it easier to travel with. We kept it in our diaper bag. Now I am in the market for a used potty ring!",0
"I agree, this is a piece of junk. No instructions whatsoever, and the adhesive does not work! very poor design- buy something else!",0
"This bag is great to keep just the necessities and it will hold all your stuff (water, wallet, cell phone & keys) plus your babies. The material is crunchy and noisy but does not make noise while walking only when reaching in and getting something.",1
"It looks cute but the wire is too short, the clip is big and hard which hurts my baby if he touches it.",0
I bought this for my great niece. It is a perfect present for any baby. The light pattern fills the room with gentle light and doesn't disturb the baby's sleep.,1
I ordered this for my daughter but it was not comfortable for her. She said it was too big. She is petite and wanted something smaller.,0
"My daughter is captivated by the music and colors. Starting at about 2 weeks of age, this has been the only thing she will watch and enjoy for more than 5 minutes. We love this product.",1
My daughter is after everything in my house including electric outlets. I don't have the hole for screw in outlet. What's the point of this product at least they have to provide with sticky tape. Knobs cover and corners are garbage not useful.My advise put something heavy behind outlets and other eclectic devices to keep your child away from it.,0
Happy to say that it also works with the Dreambaby Swing Close Gate. We're using it with iron spindles. It's been up for 6 months now and no adjustments necessary.,1
After the first time I used the pump the adapter stopped working. I called First Years and they asked me to send it back on my dime. I asked them what to do mean while. They suggested using batteries. I tried that for a couple pumps but the batteries had to be changed after every pump. This was the biggest waste of money. Purchasing this has taught me one great lesson. Do you reseach before purchasing something of this great importance. I have since thrown the peace of trash in the trash. I never sent the adapter back to First Years. To do so would cost me another $10 after using my Fedex employee discount.,0
"DO NOT BUY UNSAFE - see photo and note's in image gallery for this item to understand what I am talking about.Let me make this simple if you want something just like this but with out the annoyance of the chest strap adjuster on the child's chest with a long dangerous strap. Then get the cosco 5 pt harness booster they sell at walmart or target for the same price if not cheaper for the same thing but better made and a step up from this seat. Or invest a little more cash and get a better model all together.Pro's - Easy to install, easy to wash, all put together so easy to set up. Compact & light weight. Cheap, if on a limited budget.Con's - Durableness, safety, ease of use, etc.Some of the reasons you should NOT buy this seat -Once you wash it can be hard to put back together.Cheap is not always a pro in this case, as it's some what hazardous with it's chest adjuster & flimsy plastics.Poorly made arm rest when install correctly are flimsy and the child will rip apart! Cup holders do not stay on for long after a few weeks falls off seat and won't stay on. If left off there is holes where children can hurt their fingers (other company's recalled seats for this VERY reason!)Uncomfortable for child any age, unless they are very thin.Short back for it's intended age range; unable to adjust to a higher height. Thus being dangerous again in the event of an accident, if childs head reaches top end there is not neck or head protection. I can assure you having owned 10 car seats now, will not hold up! I wouldn't expect it to protect a child at any age in the event of an accident.We owned this seat 2 months before I gave up and donated it free to a family with no seat for their child as any seat is better then no seat in this case. I did warn them though of it's issues and why I choose not to use it. Some people don't care. But I do as my child's life is worth all the money in the world.Please if you really want something cheap, 5 pt, cup holder/ arm rest, to last awhile go to the cosco brand High Back Booster Car Seat I know they have one with arm rests now as long as you get a newer one like the one at target, you should be fine. They run $45.00 + tax which I have seen was a black model and manufactured only 3 months ago.",0
"My 4.5 month old daughter absolutely loved this jumper from the moment I stuffed her into it. And that is my one complaint... I feel like I had to 'stuff' her into it. I do admit my little girl is in the 90th percentile for weight at 17 pounds but I still expected a bit more room. As much as she enjoys this jumper, I am concerned we won't be able to use it much longer due to the small seat size. She has waaaay more room in her exersaucer. Although the exersaucer is always fun for her, she really just LOVEs this jumper the most.",1
"I bought this for a friend who has a two and four year old with newborn twins. The two and four year old both love the ride along behind the twins. It is well made and attaches and detaches easily. It is especially helpful for the two year old to keep her ""with the group"". The only bad thing is it does not have a strap to keep her on it and it is dangerous for her to get off whenever she wants (she is very active). It can be taken off easily when the stoller is folded for the car.",1
"This monitor may have a nice appearance, and nice features, but it is the worst product I have ever dealt with. I was completely shocked, seeing that it is a Fisher Price item. The night show is nice, the music is nice, and all the features are nice-if they worked! The first time my baby cried, it turned on by itself-which I thought was great. Until her screams persisted, and it would turn off, then on again, then off again. If I turn it on, and she cries, it goes off. Last night, I went to turn it on quickly because I saw she was waking, as soon as I touched the &quot;Soothe&quot; button, she let out a wail and it turned off. When it does stay on, it stays on for 5 minutes. Also, the most important feature does not work- I cannot hear anything going on in her room. I originally had the Safety 1st Grow with me monitor, but it unfortunately broke, so I figured I'd try this one. With the Safety 1st monitor, I could hear what was going on outside, I could hear her breathing, I could hear what was going on in the room next to it. With this one, I cannot hear anything until her screams are loud. Even with her wailing, I have an annoying clicking noise that prevents from hearing anything that can actually be heard out of this monitor. The power switch is hard to turn on; it is just a horrible product that I would not recommend to anyone. There are other ways to get a light show and music or sounds. I have the environment sounds machine, and I can do without the night show-it didn't even interest my baby.",0
We use cloth diapers and the compartment that flips around to drop it into the pail was not big enough. The diapers got caught in it and ripped the gasket off causing the pail to malfunction. We had to return it which just puts plastic in the landfill. It is very difficult to work the latch/blue clip to open the pail. My guess it that it would work much better for disposables.,0
"This product is great!! I spent three weeks trying to make a boppy or a fortress of pillows work for me, they never did. My daughter kept slipping closer to me. Finally I bought this and breastfeeding is great!!Only drawback is you need two hands to put it on. Definite buy for new mothers.",1
"Wow! My hubby and I love this monitor. Our 1st is 3 months old now. We put the camera up on the wall above her closet, and can see the whole crib... the best thing is I can look and see she is okay and just sleeping, or restless or whatever without actually going in her room and risking her seeing me. The sound is crystal clear from anywhere in our 2000 sq ft home. I don't use the 900Mhz phone near the screen because it does get static-y, but the 2.4Ghz works fine near it. When people ask my hubby what the best thing we bought it, he automatically says the monitor!",1
"bought the Sure and Secure Extra Tall Top of Stairs Gate with Alarm to prevent my son from falling down the stairs and to keep my 2 dogs downstairs. Needless to say the ALARM BUTTON POPPED OFF WITHIN 10 MINUTES of installing the gate and the only way to shut the alarm off was to remove the batteries. So no more alarm which was one of the reasons for buying this product.A few weeks later the ""stopper"" at the top of the gate to prevent the gate from opening towards the stairs COMPLETELY BROKE OFF!!!My dogs are also able to open the gate from on the steps.I have emailed customer service and am waiting for a response.",0
"Great diaper bag and build really steady, surely will last a long time. The bag has a many compartments and accessories. The price is really HIGH, but for long term, I believe it is work every pennies.",1
"This product is hard to assemble and the instructions that come with it is terrible. If you assemble it incorrectly, due to poor instructions, you may end up breaking something. In my case, I broke one of the pins and did not have the patience to either ask for a refund or an exchange. This manufacturer needs to learn how to write instruction manuals from IKEA (furniture company) where there are no words, just pictures. I would not recommend this product.",0
"My 3 month old son loved this toy! However, one of the bunnies stopped jumping within 3 days. I exchanged it for another one which broke in 2 days. How disappointing because he loved kicking them and watching them pop up! If someone could improve on this concept I'd buy it in a minute!",0
"These are fine gates, technically speaking, and they work well, but they are incredibly wide and don't fit ANY of our doorways!! Silly me, I didn't think to measure before ordering because I assumed that no one would sell a gate that was wider than the average doorway/hallway/stair, and so now I have to deal with shipping them back. So measure very carefully before ordering these!!!",0
We used the Y-cut nipples when our daughter started rice cereal. The nipples worked great and didn't flow too fast. Would definitely recommend rather than cutting a regular nipple.,1
"I bought this bottle bag because I have a diaper bag made by the same company that I was happy with. The bag is quite attractive, but I was pretty disappointed when I realized that it is near impossible to fit three 9oz Avent bottles in it. Then after a week of use the zipper puller broke off. The bag is now useless. I recommend you get a Playtex Fridge-to-Go instead. I have been using one for months and it still works great without having to mess with icepacks. I also bought a Munchkin bottle bag instead that works great. Don't waste your money on this bag!",0
"This glider is terrific for breastfeeding and chilling out with the baby. It's very smooth, comfortable, and looks decent, too. I would recommend shelling out for this more expensive and plumper-cushioned one, since you need all the cushioning you can get after birth and in the high-repetition on-demand breastfeeding schedule. One word of warning: the company ships these things in the cheapest, flimsiest box EVER and they can get damaged, so inspect CAREFULLY (the damage will probably be evident from both outside and inside the box, if you know what I mean) and snap photos and contact customer service to get replacement parts/pieces. Unfortunately, our ottoman was badly cracked in transit and the glider was dinged and a plastic piece that locks the unit was broken. We asked for a replacement for the ottoman but just for the broken part for the glider. It came without too much delay, but what a hassle. If it was all broken you'd have to ship it back...what a huge huge pain. But I do really really like this rocker (in cherry).",0
We bought this for our banister. Did not work for our needs. You basically get a stack of string to tie it on with. We tied it on and it left gaps everywhere and our daughter could basically slide her hands over the top and Yank it down. Also where the banister meets the wall we got it as close as we could but since it ties on we could only get it about an inch from the wall at the closest. Our daughter easily pushed right past it. We returned it for a refund after just a few days.,0
"We love this car seat!!!!Britax is the best, the product is comfortable and the color is so beautiful.I feel good that my 9 months daughter is safe and I can tell that this car seat is not expensive because the quality is incredible and it's so easy to install.I'll buy 3 more...2 for my toddlers and one for my other baby girl.",1
This is a good looking dog crate. And it was very easy to put together. Just a wonderful product.,1
"I bought these spoons when my son first started solids (around 5 1/2 months). At the same time I also bought the gerber infant spoons. At first, I felt these spoons were too big, so I used the gerber spoons most of the time. Within 6 weeks I had switched to using THESE spoons most of the time. Now at 8 months, I feel that the gerber spoons are too small, and I only use them if none of my Sassy spoons are clean. It is crazy how fast they grow and change. These spoons have held up well to many, many washes in the dishwasher. The color change is a bit sensitive- but I'd rather be too cautious then give something that's too hot to my little guy. Great spoons- I'd buy them again in a second.",0
"This is by far the best potty seat for toilets on the market! I've tried several others, and this is far superior to any others. Since it is adjustable, this potty seat doesn't shift at all when put on the toilet seat.The sit down Baby Bjorn potty is also wonderful. For potty training, we're only going with Baby Bjorn products from now on!",1
"I never write reviews, but this time I am very disappointed... SO, After reading all good reviews I was very excited when the kits arrived - I ordered two. I thought the frame was supposed to be made of wood, but no - it's made of some cheap wood-like material that crumbles easily. BOTH frames were completely broken when I opened the packages. I am glad Amazon has such easy return process.",0
"This stroller was recommemded to me by a friend who had tried all the strollers and found that less was more. I'm glad I listened to her because I love this stroller!. It's easy to carry around and fits perfectly into my Jeep Liberty. It's also easy to navigate when shopping and even has a basket and cup holders for Mommy. Also, when paired with the Navy blue Snugride Graco infant seat, it looks like a cute little baby buggy.One thing that would be nice, though, is if the basket was a little bigger for those larger shopping trips.",1
"I got his lamb and found out it's just another baby thing that will be seldom used. Babies don't really care about the ocean, whale or the rain sounds, they don't know what those sounds are! This lamb with sounds are more geared for adults who find them relaxing. It's a cuddly stuff toy, minus the velcro at the back. Good marketing though by making it sound like it's something every parents must have. I say not!",1
"I bought this cover for my cribmattress.It fits perfectly(130 /70/10 cm)with the elastic lining. It's comfortable to lay on, is easy to wash in the washingmachine. I let it dripdry after washing. don't think it will survive a dryer well. I believe it would fit a 15 cm thick mattress too.I am happy I bought this one. I'll order a other one for when this one is worn out.",1
"I installed two gates in my home. After a little over one year both locking mechanisms broke (with 3 days of each other). The gates must be replaced.The instruction manual said ""if you are not satisfied for any reason, call us..."" I explained the product failures to RC2 brand and the response was simple: ""Thanks for your inquiry. The mechanism is not a replacement part. Unfortunately, you will have to purchase a new gate.Thanks, Theresa""The gates were great when they worked. I expected these to last at least 2-3 years, oh well. I will replace both gates with another brand.",0
"I bought this chair because it matched my kitchen and since we knew it would be sitting out all the time that was important to me. When my daughter was first using the chair it was great because it is very sturdy and the belly/leg straps held her inside. However, she is now 10 months old and feeding herself. The chair has become very hard to keep clean. Along the sides of the chair (beside your child's legs) are what look like wooden rails. Food gets stuck between the rails and underneath the back padding. I either have to suck the food out with the vaccuum cleaner or push it through the rails with a butter knife in order to get all of the pieces and parts out. The chair would be much better without these rails or if the entire white plastic piece was removable. My suggestion would be to look for another sturdy chair that is easier to keep clean.",0
I think the chair would serve it's purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage/travel seemed way too cheap for me. The paint on the metal was scratching off when I twisted the arms to fold it. I only tried it on a counter so I can't say how it works on a table with a skirt but I returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by Phil & Ted called MeToo. The Phil & Ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but doesn't come with a travel bag where this one does. I can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me. And the MeToo chair does go on my table with a skirt.,0
"I bought this for my daughter to keep in the trunk of her car. Now she has her own seat, (that we know is clean) It folds flat and has its own storage bag. Very easy to use and handy to have. It also attaches snuggly so it won't fall off!",1
I was so excited to find my favorite diapers on Amazon.com for the same price as another popular diaper & stuff website. I could buy them here without having to spend another seven or eight bucks to get free shipping. The price even made for a better deal than Target! Now the price jumped from $41.99 to $49.84! This new price totally takes the deal out of the deal. You know what I mean? I still plan on buying these diapers and I still plan on looking for other great deals on Amazon.com (this is a pretty great place to find baby toys!). But where the diapers are concerned? I am giving another company my revenue for now. And I'm pretty disappointed about having to do so. But every dollar counts.,1
"When I bought the product, it was indicated that it would fit most standard faucets. Upon the product arriving, it did not fit either of the standard faucet in my home. In addition, all other faucet covers that I have looked at were a little bit plyable. This was not. In fact it was hard, and the rubber it is made out of was not forgiving on little heads. I suggest to keep looking. I ended up finding a cute frog that did work on standard faucets, for about $5 at Wal-mart.",0
I absolutely love my Bjorn!! It's especially nice when I have to do things around the house and my baby wants to be close to me.,1
"As other reviewers have noted, the tray does not contain 12 1 oz cubes, but 12 1/2 oz cubes. The four cubes on the end are angled in and have rounded corners so they are even smaller. Granted the packaging does say ""approximate"" but being off by 15 ml is not close enough to call approximate in my book. Having 1/2 oz cubes does not necessarily bother me, what does bother me is the inaccuracy of the product description.As for the product itself, I purchased it to freeze breast milk so that I could place exact portions into storage bags. When I first opened the trays I was pleased by how sturdy and heavy they were, but after using them I have found that I should not have been pleased. The plastic is so heavy it is impossible to get any flex. The only way I can get the cubes out is to run warm water over the bottom of the tray. Partially thawing my breast milk to place it in storage bags is the last thing I want to do.",0
I thought I would use this and just had to have it. It might be good if you don't have an iphone with an app because I found it was good to keep track of things in the early months. The app I found for free on my phone worked even better though because it kept a log of what had been happening from day one.,1
I give it one star because i am not the first one to mention this; after one month ts started showing temperature 5 degrees above the actual water temperature. For the sake of other buyer i hope this thing only errors one way (showing water hotter than actual instead of colder than actual).,0
"This is great product with the Diaper Dekor + system. The refills last forever, it has been 5 months and we are on our 1st refill! The can looks good, and also doubles as a trash can. Can't say a bad thing about it!",1
"I have to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of this at first. I wished I had one of those plastic tubs when my daughter was a bit younger so that I could stand and bath her on the counter. But now that she is 2 months old I have changed my mind. She loves to lay on this pillow in the water and kick like crazy. It's wonderful because I have an extra hand, one that would normally have to hold her up in the water. I think it is relaxing for a young baby. I highly reccomend this item.",1
"This product is fabulous! No more strapping the seat belt and un-stapping every time you need to go in and out of the car. It is a must to have a second base in your ""other"" car Just prop in the car seat and go!",1
"These are great cups for a mom who is sick of 100 parts to all bottles and sippys - I love these. My 15 month old daughter also loves these who started using these at about 12 months. One of the issues though is that the holes are small and so the flow is very slow - unless you poke bigger holes through - which was not a problem and easy to do - but then she realized if you turn them upside down the liquid basically pours out. But there really was not a leakage problem before that and she did throw them on the ground and the lid did not bust off like many walmart models we tried. These cups lived up to what they looked like they were to be. It was only when I saw mold under the mouth piece that I could not possibly get to with a sponge or brush did I have to do away with them. And also, even if they are BPA free and such - all plastics are made with other chemicals so do not wash these in a dishwasher where the chemicals can leach into the drink. These are made to be used and disposed of (like zip lock bags) so buy new ones often so the plastic does not get worn and leach.",0
"We bought this after many recommendations from other parents. We weren't disappointed!! My son is now 4 months old and LOVES to sit in it, play with the toys, and especially jump! He will gladly sit in it for longer than any other toy we've had so far. I can get the dishes done and other house chores without having to stop to entertain him every 5 minutes! He screams with delight...in fact, he grabbed for a toy for the very first time in his Jumperoo. Best $89 spent so far on a baby gadget (and believe me - we have purchased a lot!)",1
"My little man has rejected all the teethers and/or pacifiers I have ever given him and this one worked! He loves it! The teether was a bit large for his mouth when we first got it, but he chewed all the other parts happily. Because the entire thing is soft, it gives them a lot of choices to chew even if it won't quite fit in their mouth yet. Now, if he's fussy and I get out the RaZberry - instant calm!",1
"This Sesame Street bath towel and mitt set is still our favorite bath towel set. The towels are cute, soft, and durable. I wish I could buy more for my second baby!",1
I purchased these for our basement door so our cat could get to her litter box. Like another reviewer ours ripped. More so if you take it off once and a while to be able to close the door. And even when we did not remove the panda we had it rip. We did super glue it and it would work for a while.,1
"We liked the two receiver idea, but the poor sound quality was not worth it. The receivers didn't work well in our house, frequently noisy and out of range. We went with a Sony monitor, which we love. Moving the receiver around is no big deal at all!",0
"In general I'm glad that I own this product, but I am sure that I would be fine without it; it's a luxury item.I bought the Brest Friend for breastfeeding my first baby. After trying it out on the first day home from the hospital, I thought I'd surely not use it because it was very awkward to use it while sitting in my glider and very difficult to use with any other hold but the cradling hold; the ""football"" hold was the easiest for me when I first trying to breastfeed and this hold was so clumsy using the Brest Friend that I just used my own bed pillows.After 3 weeks of breastfeeding, though, I gave the Brest Friend another try and it turned out to be very convenient! I could now type at a keyboard, use a mouse, operate a remote control, even eat a sandwich while breastfeeding with the Brest Friend! It is, however, still awkward to get clipped on when holding a hungry, fussy baby :-/If you have the $ for such a luxury item, it's nice to have around, but pillows work nearly as well ;-)",0
This toy really helped my son in walking and has very cute features on it. There is also a slow stage and faster with the wheels. Works well!,1
"This stroller works great for my girls. 1 1/2 and 4. They both fit comfortably and enjoy the smooth ride the stroller provides. Excellent turning and steering control. Cloth cup holder works pretty well. The basket on the bottom doesn't have much of a lip, but I haven't dropped anything yet. It's heavy but opens and closes easily.",1
"Reasons we love this bathtub:1) The tub is deep enough and large enough to fit most of the baby's body underwater so she doesn't get cold, yet the angle of the body support keeps her mouth/ears out of the water.2) The tub is very big, so we won't need another one later on. It's small enough on the infant side to hold our 5 pound baby girls, and the toddler side is definitely large enough for a MUCH bigger baby.3) The molded body supports cradle the baby to make her feel secure, and they keep the baby from slipping around. We put a hand towel underneath for some cushion & softness, but the tub design is fabulous all on it's own.4) The tub is VERY easy to fill, drain & clean. Just fill, bathe, drain and rinse it out. No foam or mesh inserts that can get mold or bacteria.Our twin girls feel so comfortable, relaxed and secure in this tub that they fall asleep during bath time. We have such an easy bath time - it's the most peaceful part of the day. I just wish I'd had one of these for my first baby!",1
"I am sure this is a great product (as seen by all the other reviews), but my 5-month nephew hates it. Perhaps it'll be useful when he gets older (the berry is kinda large), but he has started teething and I was disappointed to see that he doesn't want the RaZberry.",0
"The only thing a tub is supposed to do is hold water in it. If it leaks, it's completely failing to do it's job and I read the instructions.",0
"The UltraSoft Quilted Mattress Pad should be the only pad to buy! It fits the mattress perfectly &amp; doesn't shrink when washed. It is very soft, comfortable, and waterproof too.",1
"I came accross these diapers when I was searching the website for a more natural diaper for my now 10 month old daughter since she has really bad diaper rash that I can't seem to get rid of. I used to use the Walmart brand diapers and wipes and wanted to change her into something more natural for her. Don't get me wrong, the walmart brand is great, used them for all my kids. But for her, I was concerned that she was allergic to the inks, dyes and perfumes you find in alot of the baby products these days. The huggies diapers are comfortable and fit well to her body and around her legs. During the day, they absorb well as long as I changed her every 2-3 hrs. However I wouldn't recommend going through the whole night with them. Alot of mornings (around 7am) I would pick her up and she would be soaked through. When I noticed this, I started changing her diaper halfway through the night or very early in the morning. The other down side for me was that this diaper has ink/dyes on the inside of the leg. If she has on just her diaper, she will scratch her skin raw in that area. I did alot of research, but was never able to find a picture showing the inside of the diaper so I didn't know there was ink on the leg openings before I purchased them. The main reason I chose Huggies was that I used them (not necessarily the Snug and Dry) on my now six yr old son and at that point, they had no ink or dyes in them. He was allergic to Luvs. Plus the subscribe and save option made it price wise for me. Sorry to say that I won't buy the Huggies Snug and Dry Diapers again nor would I recommend them to anyone. But I do still like Huggies brand for other items.",0
We bought this 3 years ago for our first born...then used it for our second child..and now bought it as a gift for a friend. It was wonderful to have our children so close while they were &lt;6 months of age. We initially lived in a house with a smallish master bedroom so the mini co-sleeper was perfect. We even brought it on trips with us because it folded up so easily.The only negative thing I have to even offer is that you should realize ahead of time that you have to scoot down some in order to be able to get out of your bed. Not a big deal to me--but it prevented one of my relatives from ordering it.Great product that has withstood the test of time!Highly recommended.,1
"Got this for my 4 month old when his activity mat got boring for him. He LOVES to bounce in it & play with all the toys. He's already learned to turn in the seat by himself. Buy it, your kids will love it.",1
I do not like this product at all. It's not very safe and the tray is a real inconvenience. My 2 month old son fell out of it when I was about to fasten the tray in. I was lucky he was not hurt because I was there to catch him. I do not recommend this product.,0
"I am very happy with how well this cup keeps beverages cold. I used to pour out a lot more sour milk before I started using these. My 2 year old has no problem opening and closing the lid, and this cup is less likely to leak than the Munchkin straw cups I have used up until now. These are very similar to the Thermos ""Funtainer"" cups, but they do differ in the straw assembly. I found a blog that explains it very well http://babytoolkit.blogspot.com/2007/05/thinking-thermos-funtainer-and-foogo.html but basically, the Foogo cups are designed to be more safe for smaller children. These are very well designed, user-friendly cups. My only knock on these is the process required to obtain replacement straws. There is no way to simply buy them at a store or order them online. You have to call Thermos customer service at 1-800-831-9242 during business hours (they close at 4:30pm central time) and if you call after hours, you could sit on hold forever without realizing that they're closed. I called at 2:30pm central time and got right through and was able to order the replacement straws I needed easily enough. They only cost $1 each, plus a small shipping charge. My suggestion would be to jump through this hoop as soon as you purchase your cups so that you have them on hand when you need them. I wash mine in the dishwasher and they have held up just fine. One of my straws slipped through the cracks and melted on the metal element in my dishwasher, hence the need for a replacement. The bottom line is that I've had these cups for 6 months now and I love them. I'm buying a few more to phase out my older plastic Munchkin cups. They are well worth a few extra dollars.",1
"I love this product. It is nice and sturdy, yet it is soft so my baby won't get hurt bumping into it or falling on it. It also looks attractive in her room compared to the plastic toy boxes. She loves keeping her toys in it and exploring all its features (it has a lot). Great value for the money!",1
"I love the this set ,expecially the nail cutter, I,m still using mine after six years.",1
"I received this monitor set as a gift. One of the receivers didn't even work straight from the package. When I called customer support, they were so uncooperative and told me that since I didn't have the receipt, there were nothing they can do. That was the least of the problems we experienced with this monitor. The static it picks up is unbelievable! It would pick up the noise of our dryer so loudly that we always questions whether we hear the baby. Also, the whole set stopped working one night after a few weeks, so now we have to look for a new monitor set pronto!",0
I ordered this item thinking it would be plain ivory for my daughter. When I received it the blanket was white with blue trim. I wish the pictures or descriptions would describe the item better next time!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"A must buy product!! My son is 5 months old and I been watching this item since he was 1 month old and I just didn't want to waste the money on it if he wasn't going to get use out of it. We have the rainforest play yard and he is very amazed with the mobile so I decided to order this Jumperoo amd it was the best move ever!!! I just received it yesterday and he is so excited!!! He is a big boy and this jumperoo is exercise for him. He was in it twice so far and he already jumps and bounces and spins and he makes sure he is touching every last toy surrounding him. DON""T BE A BORING PARENT..............Order one today!!!!",1
"We got this for a shower gift and the first 3-4 weeks our baby didnt seem to notice it. But starting at about 5 weeks he became totally facinated with it. He loves to watch the black and white spirals go around and as he develops seems to notice more and more about it. I dont mind that it makes noise because we don't use it to try to put him to sleep. I use it mostly to stimulate him AND MOST IMPORTANTLY to give Mom a break! I can put him under it to take a shower, to start dinner and like now to write a review! WHile most things (swing, playmat) seem to amuse him for 10 min if lucky, this has worked up to 45 min...and yes he has occassionally fallen asleep. After it's through playing, he squeals to let me know its time to push the button again. I really do recommend this. Of course every baby is different so what works for one doesnt always work for another.",1
I recieved this tub as a shower gift and unfortunately it was horrible. After about two weeks worth of use the pump no longer worked. The fabric on the bath seat completely ripped and could not be fixed. I used the tub for about five months then I had to buy another tub for my daughter because she wanted to sit up and there was no way for her to sit in this tub. Not a practical item.,0
"I bought this for our first plane and cruise trip with my 21 month old son. Quality of the bag is great especially the zipper. I can use only one hand to zip it and it doesn't twist. Very smooth. Very roomy. I put some snacks on the top packet, diapers on the outer pocket. The main storage pocket is very roomy. I put an ipad, portable DVD player, and some toys in there. It stands well when you put it on the table. And the straps feel comfortable. But I wouldn't use it when not traveling because I am used to purse style diaper bag. But it's great for husband and traveling.",1
"been looking for the most comfortable carseat for my 5 month old daughter, upon searching for the best reviews i can find, i decided to get this one from britax, so far this is the best purchase i did for my baby, she is very comfortable, easily sleeps on it, plus the color and design is sooo girly.. i definitely would recommend this to moms who wants nothing but the best for their babies.",1
"Not much to review, they're pampers, they're swaddlers, and they came safe and sound in their giant original packaging, yellow and all, and best of all, amazon has 'em cheap. Yeah, its close to 200 diapers, but we'll use them. And so would you. So why not?",1
"I purchased this for a shower gift after having a child of my own and thinking that this product could have saved me some wondering during blurry-eyed nights. Of course months after the shower after the baby arrives, the couple removes the packaging and throws it away before turning it on- the display is broken. It has a few bars showing and the functions don't work. How embarrassing to spend money on a shower gift only to have it broken!! With the packaging gone, I assumed I couldn't return it so I apologized to the couple and flushed $25 down the toilet.",0
"The only good thing about this tub is the sling. The sling has helped me give my little girl her baths in the sink. Because babies are so slippery when they are getting their baths, the sling helps keep their tiny heads out of the water. The tub itself is pretty much a waste of time and money. I have tried numerous times to use the tub, but it keeps leaking on me, no matter what. The tub collapses, which sounds like a great idea, but when it is in use it leaks where there is a ""seal"". My husband and I have both got to the point where we have stood inside of the tub to try to make the seal tighter. The next tub I buy will be one that is all in one piece and that does not collapse.",0
"This is the perfect first birthday present. This will be the keepsake that will always remind her, everytime she loses a tooth, of that special day she recieved this keepsake.This is also an heirloom quality piece. She can pass this down to her daughter as tradition on her first birthday. It's so wonderfully made, in sterling silver, and it's topped off by an amazingly beautiful little toothfairy of gold on the lid. It's a perfect keepsake or gift for any age in my opinion, not just infants.",1
Great choice for a diaper bag! It's sturdy and my husband doesn't mind carrying it around!,1
Luv this pillow and slip cover. My old Boppy pillow was really flat. It is nice to have a new Boppy for my new little man. Would recommend this pillow with any slip cover to any nursing mom.,1
"these bottles are terrible...buy dr. browns! I wasted so much money on these! My daughter could not get enough formula, the nipples had to be cut (other friends of mine have had to do this as well) and they leak. It was a nightmare.",0
Fabric is very thin. Bought for my 7 month old grandson but he likes to jump up & down while eating & I was afraid the seams would rip.,0
My little one loves this lady bug. The stars are sharp crisp and clear and there's only one moon. We have fun looking for the moon on the ceiling when she first gets to bed. We have a lot less anxiety around bedtime now.,1
"Love this product. It's easy to use, easy to take along, clean up is a cinch. No worries about what's on the table UNDER the topper. We've had three restaurant employess (different restaurants) ask about the product for their customers with little ones.",1
"We have a 5 month old and a 3 year old. The good things about this stroller are that because it is narrow it fits anywhere. It's not any heavier than our Gracco travel system single stroller, but not light by any means. It holds our Gracco carseat fine, and it manuevers fine with both kids on it. It has a small storage basket under toddler seat which holds a few small items.The not so great things about this stroller are, there is no cup/item holder. We purchased the Joovy Parent Organizer for about $25 and I'm glad. It can hold a bottle of water and my wallet. The stroller is very long when it's folded up, we have a Tahoe and it just fits the width of the back, if we had anything smaller than a Tahoe it would not fit in the trunk. When my toddler sits on the seat our baby kicks him in the head, this will be fixed once the baby moves out of the carrier but it does make my toddler not want to sit unless he really has to. I would definitely recommend it over a double stroller, especially if you have a younger child like mine that wants to sit, then stand then walk all within a 5 minute period. Just be sure it fits in your car.",1
"I bought these to keep my toddler out of my IKEA HEMNES television stand drawers. The design of these drawers is straightforward and their surfaces are totally flat so I thought these locks would work perfectly. I was wrong. First of all, the instructions are ambiguous. Secondly, the stick-on template is useless. I followed the instructions to the letter on my first drawer and once the lock was installed, it wasn't effective and my drawer wouldn't close all the way. My toddler pulled it right open. After that, I made my own measurements and placed the lock and catch where I thought they would work. Through trial and error, I eventually found the placement where my drawer would close and the lock would catch (and, yes, I ended up drilling way too many holes in my drawer,) but the it was still easily opened without the key. Then I turned the catch around; I screwed it in opposite the direction shown in the instructions. I used what I'd learned from that first drawer on the other two and now my TV stand is child proof...no thanks to Safety 1st. If you decide to buy these, I would reccomend that you experiment with the placement using tape before you make any holes. That said, I really don't think it's worth the trouble. Yes, these locks are invisible from the outside, but an easier, less painful option would be better for your well being and life in general [read: don't buy this if you have high blood pressure!]",0
"To Anonymous in AZ:I've used this seat when both of my children were infants. I just used the little u-shped head cushion to help steady them, but I felt the seat is so safe that I didn't bother with an infant carrier. Just a personal preference and my little ones always did just fine in it. I love this seat & would deffinitley buy it again or reccomend it to anyone. Hope this helps.",1
"After having tried the Thirsties covers, Proraps and the Bummi Whisper Wraps, the Thirsties win hands down. I've found that the Bummis tend to leak more because there are no gussets around the legs and the layer of cloth that is on the inside actually seems to wick the moisture outside so I end up not only changing the diaper but also my baby's clothes (and sometimes sheets!) whenever I use them. While this may be ok during the day, it is definitely not fun at night! The cloth on the inside also stains easily with poopy diapers so reusing the covers are just not an option as they are with the Thirsties (you can just wipe down the inside and they're ready to go) which means more washing. After only about 2 months of use, the Bummis also seem more worn and old-looking. Overall, I would say--spend your money on another cover. For the same cost, who needs a cover that makes it harder, not easier, to cloth diaper?",0
"The short, chunky handles are easy for my two-year old girls to hold, and the shape of the spoon helps the food stay on the spoon long enough to make it into their mouths.",1
"My son will be one years old this month, and this potty is great!I do own this EXACT model, but the potty is red with a white catch pot... I can see how the color maybe important (our son LOVES elmo, and now LOVES red... so thats the big issue!) I have seen them in this color, red, light blue, yellow, and pink... so you can really pick your color, just not off of amazon. The potty IS comfortable to sit on for a while, he is potty training early because he showed alot of interest, and has been walking since 10 months old. The potty is low to the ground and SMALL, but hes a small fella so this doesnt bother us. His brother (3) can also fit on it and trust me hes not a little guy! The shape is very unique and he will sit contently and lean back, and the arm rests are cute, but he doesnt use them like that. The splash guard is high enough to help him (although he hasnt actually gone, but I can see it will work... and my 3 year old used it with ease as well). The splash guard also works as a handle to get the catch pot out, thats probably why theres a gaurd on the pink potty too, so I sugest using toilet paper to lift it, and always wash your hands after! The catch pot is nice and deep, so my son will be able to lift it by himself without making a mess. It CAN come off easily, but since its impossible to come off while the baby is sitting, I dont mind. And this also makes for a great toy, but yet again its only 2 pieces so I found this not to be a problem. ITs easy to wash out the catch pot in the sink, and easy to wipe up the seat. ITs not cushy or padded, but it isnt uncomfortable, and he doesnt get a red ring around his tush (although we only keep him on for 5-10 minutes... he's wearing diapers/pull-ups still... so if he happens to go after hes off its not a big deal... no need to keep them on it for 20-30 minutes!) The potty is lightweight and easy for him to move around the bathroom, but when hes on the potty and pushes a bit, he goes around backwards... this is a bit annoying because he winds up all over the place and has almost flipped it backwards. There really should be grippers on the bottom, so we added some and it solved the problem of it sliding all over the place, but he can still tip it backwards. My niece (2 1/2) has it in pink and can use it with the splash gaurd the way its supposed to be. She holds onto it like a handle and it doesnt bother her, she just manuvers around it, and the first time they get hurt they learn to be careful!I love this potty due to its ease of use and ease to clean, but due to the annoyance of it moving around, the lack of grippers, and the price make it worthy of a great, but not excellent score of 4.",1
"I had a meltdown at Disney World trying to figure out how to use this thing but then another mommy came up and helped me get my newborn fit in it correctly. Once she showed me, it was pretty ez but I wish I would have practiced a few times before I was stuck in the middle of a crowed trying to figure it out! Baby slept in it most of the time we walked around the theme park. We even put my 2 year old who is around 35 lbs in it and he fell asleep (my husband had to carry him in it). I would say it's great to have as long as you are patient and can have someone help you get baby situated into it.",1
"I'M SO AFAID MY BABY IS GOING TO FALL OUT! IF I HAD THE BOX IT WOULD GO BACK. OUR SON IS 11WEEKS OLD,HE IS 24 INCHES LONG, AND HIS WEIGHT 12LB 12OZ. DON'T BUY THIS SWING IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR BABY FALLING OUT OF IT.",0
I absolutely LOVE this swing! And so does my son. The lights and mobile are mesmerizing to him. The design is just wonderful. It would be nice if the animals in the water globe moved around though. We have used it so much. He has taken so many naps in this swing. It's the best on the market.,1
"After less than two months the monitor started beeping randomly for no apparent reason. We called the company and they sent us a new one. It doesn't work well either. The monitor beeped 4 times last night waking us up more than the baby. No more headaches for us. It's going back to the store and we're getting a different make and model tonight.Don't waste your time on this monitor, the product is obviously flawed based on all the consistent reviews. Btw, as I write this review the monitor has beeped 3 times already.",0
Why are these so expensive on Amazon? I use these on a daily basis and could never afford them at this price. I buy these at Walmart - 40 for $2.22 - regular price - The same goes for the individual packets - they are $2.25 per pkg of 16 from Walmart.,0
"All of a sudden, after three months of fairly steady use, the music and lights just stopped working. We replaced the batteries twice, but soon realized that was not the problem. It's a shame because I would've gotten a cheaper mat which may have lasted longer, had it not been for the great reviews on this crapper. Our daughter is now 4.5 months old and is about to the point that she cares whether there are lights and music...",0
compre este producto ya que no lo encontraba se me hacia muy dificil tenia todos los numero menos este numero y me hacia falta para mi beba excelente articulo,1
"These diapers work well, haven't had problems with leaks, and I really like that there are no dyes, bleach or perfumes in them. They do seem to run a little small though. So you may need to get a bigger size sooner than the pkg. would say. (instead of starting size 2 at 12 pounds, start it at 11, etc.)",1
"The problem with this one was that my son's head kept falling into it and it would wrap around his face. We tried it a few times and each time he was terrified. Maybe we were doing it wrong but, if we were, they should have made it easier. However, if we were, then they designed this all wrong. Certainly not for a tall baby and possibly not for any other infants.",0
"I was so excited when I bought this carrier that I try it on the next day. But after using it for a mere 15 minutes, my shoulder hurts. I attributed the pain to my old shoulder problem and decided to have my husband try it. He tried it and developed pain on his shoulder as well (after 30 mins). He is stronger than me and our baby is about 20 lbs. My husband said he would rather just carry our baby with his own hands than using this product. Perhaps this carrier is only suitable for smaller babies or for someone that has really strong shoulder and neck. I am returning this and will be looking for a better carrier. Hopefully it won't be as pricy as this.",0
"This is the older product in the picture, which is better, that has been replaced by a cornstarch powder. It is misleading.",0
"We picked these monitors based on the largely positive reviews. They are horrible. One of the receivers has never worked properly (the lights all stay on all the time) and Fisher Price has never responded to my request for a replacement.There is so much static on these monitors that it wakes my wife up at night. You can have the monitor sitting on the table and, for no apparent reason, it just goes to a loud static for several minutes. We have tried all the channels with the same result. It doesn't matter if we are in the living room which is 15 feet from the baby's room or in our master bedroom which is across the house, the things are still full of static.I would give these monitors 0 stars if I could, but I have to give 1 to allow me to write a review. I highly recommend you select different monitors.",0
"MY TWINS LOVED THIS, THEY ACTUALLY WEREN'T AFRAID OF THE POTTY WHEN THEY SAW THIS. IT'S SMALLER FOR THERE SMALL BOTTOMS AND THE SPONGEBOB PRINT MAKES IT FUN.",1
My daughter has been playing with this gym since she was 2 days old and she still likes it 8 months later. All of the toys on this gym are a lot of fun and she likes everything about it. I have gotten a lot of use out of this toy and even hook the toys onto her stroller or car seat for her to play with on the go. What a great gym - I am so glad I got it.,1
"until we moved and this was packed for four months. We didn't think our daughter would be able to stand a cold wipe, so we rushed out and purchased this right after she was born. It was used religiously up to the point of moving. For the last four months she has had nothing but room temperature wipes and hasn't complained at all! ;) Yes, it's wonderful to wipe her little bottom with a warm wipe, but this isn't a MUCH NEEDED product.",0
"Not only is this stuff great for its intended purpose, it's incredible for new tattoos. Something that normally takes me 10 days or so to heal from has healed in less than a week. Figured I'd try it, since I was out of the normal lotion I'd use .. this stuff is just incredible!",1
I received this tub as a gift. The sprayer worked once. Customer Service was non existent from the manufacturer. I am very disappointed with this product. Your money would be better spent on another brand.,0
This did not work well at all. The concept is great but the execution is lack-luster. It started peeling off and I had to end up removing it. I guess with larger railing there really isnt much hope!,0
"Great product, the lights do not work, the sound chip in the music pad is horrid. One of the songs is B-I-N-G-O and they used the harmony instead of the melody... really? that had to happen? I would throw away the lights and sound and then its a wonderful product, my 9 week old loves it. The toys are great and they allow you to put your own toys up as well.",0
Very beautiful crib and super easy to assemble! It looks so grand and classic! The crib is so light but yet strong! We love it :),1
"Exactly what I expected. I had one of these food mills when my oldest son (now 30) was little and I loved it. This one is for my grandson, and I was happy that they still make them.",1
"I was a little nervous about buying these based on some reviews that said they got too hot or melted, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well they actually work. On the box, it clearly says take them off if you are going to use the broiler. They get warm, but not too warm to open to adjust the dial. My 14 month old son goes straight for the oven when he's in the kitchen, and it's nice to see that he simply cannot get these open.",1
"We purchased this bed five months ago for our then 16 month old. My husband was out of town when it arrived. I put it together by myself in about a half an hour with no difficulty whatsoever. It's very sturdy, all wood, and not too high off the ground. My son has slept in it from day one with no problems.",1
"This is a great product. Our baby was in the swing at 2 weeks old - and he loved it. It has given me time to cook and clean, and help get him into a nap schedule. I would like to address some of the negative reviews:Swings too fast:If it goes too fast for your child, place a heavy blanket over them and it slows them down!Cost of batteries::Buy rechargeable!!Motor Problems:We have used this daily and the mobile has stopped working. I phoned Fisher Price/Mattel and they are sending a brand new motor free of charge and I only have to wait a week - not months!I would recommend this product to any new parents. This along with the Fisher Price Kick and Play bouncer have been life savers!",0
"It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean.",0
"We received this as a gift for our daughter (now 16 months). It's a very nice looking dresser, but has not stood up well to daily use. All of the drawer knobs have pulled off at one point or another, and we've had to request replacements. We've now had the dresser for so long that they're charging us for new knobs. Also, the door hinges have had to be re-tightened several times.The wood is soft, so any nick or ding is clearly visible. This is not a concern in a baby room, but the dresser will not hold up well to toddler abuse -- we picked it specifically so it could transition from a changing table to a dresser.It was perfect for what we wanted it for initially, but it's ridiculous to have to maintain a piece of furniture that keeps dropping pieces. We'll probably end up replacing it with a sturdier dresser when my daughter transitions to her own room, which completely defeats the purpose for us.",0
There was no issues connecting this to the existing gate I had. I worked perfect. and matched perfect as well. Thank you.,1
"Finally bought this after putting up with a ""booster"" chair for years. The most important thing about this chair is that the tray can hold a pretty standard sized plate. Most of the others can only hold a very small plate or a bowl. This chair has been great.",1
"My 21 month old daughter sits on the Royal Potty like it is a chair but refuses to use it as a &quot;potty.&quot; The music only plays when you move the potty from place to place, and once when she did actually &quot;go&quot; in the potty, there was no music. The small book that comes with the potty falls apart very quickly. Fisher-Price usually makes good quality products. Unfortunately, they really bombed with this one. This potty got the royal flush from our house...it will be sold in our garage sale.",0
My Grandaughter loves them. They are so easy for her to pullup and pulldown. She also likes the Dora theme on them.,1
"It is almost impossible to see our baby with this monitor. A friend described it best when she said she felt she was looking at an ultrasound image. It is hard to tell where the baby is and we have to play with the antenna a lot to get some reception. However, the sound quality is good and there is no interference. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product.",0
I had the same problem that one of the other people had. It (the music)turnes on and off when my baby cries and it's not voice activated. I just bought it today and I guess I will be returning it tomorrow. Maybe the next one will work right. I will be exchanging for the same product. The rest of the features are great! As long as you don't have the same problem I've had - this is the perfect monitor.I'm giving this a second review! I returned the first monitor for another one and it too didn't work. I gave up on it and I'll be doing some research on getting another. I did notice more static on the second monitor. This I guess is just a poor product. Usually I am very faitful to Fisher Price. I guess they can't always have the best.,0
"My toddler son can easily reach down, lift the Velcro fabric patch, lift the metal release clamp and loosen the straps on his car seat. This first happened when I was driving in the HOV lanes during morning rush hour. It was quite a shock, and created a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, I did not have an accident, as my child would surely have been seriously injured.We own the Wizard car seat, but the Britax Boulevard (the replacement for the Wizard) and the Marathon seats all use this faulty shoulder strap system. We bought our first Wizard seat for our daughter, but not until she was 3 and had no problems with it. Therefore, we had no idea this seat was going to be hazardous for a toddler.I have since found that many other parents of toddlers have reported the same problem with these seats. I recall there were similar comments about the Wizard (which I found after the incident above), but those are no longer posted because the seat was discontinued.We are loyal owners of Britax car seats (we own one Roundabout and two Wizard car seats), but I am appalled with the design of this strapping system and outraged by Britax's response to my complaint.Britax first denied this was a design flaw and informed me that I need to teach my todder the meaning of the word ""no"". Then they told me that I should use a safety pin to secure the fabric cover. Other parents posting on BabiesRUs and Babycenter.com have reported this same ridiculous response to their complaints.I also filed a written complaint with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) and with BabiesRUs. Since Britax is not voluntarily responding to this dangerous situation, parents must take action. Take a look at the placement of the metal clamp on the Blvd., Marathon or Wizard seats. If you have had a problem with your child pulling up the clamp and loosening the straps, or if you just agree that this situation is dangerous, first file a complaint with the NHTSA at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/, then post your comments on this website. Of note, the NHTSA ratings give all three seats the top A rating for ""ease of use"" for securing the child. I agree the seats are easy to use; however, they are so easy for toddlers to use they are DANGEROUS.",0
"i am extremely pleased with my purchase, it is better than expected. Fast shipping, product in perfect condition, very good quality. would recommend.",1
"Thought this would be great for us when 2nd child was born. (we currently have a fisher price Sounds and Lights) But much to our disappointment, proved to be incompatible w/900 mghz phones and whatnot - even when not placed near phones. There was so much static - no matter what we did - as well as loud buzzing. I should note we live in private house - so there was not interference from neighbor's monitors. You have to monitor 1 or 3 zones - can't just monitor 2. Also, the most wasteful packaging I have ever seen for a product of this size! We returned it and purchased a sony 900 mghz with a lot of frequencies to choose from. Great idea for a home system - but poor execution.",0
Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster SeatBought this on recommendation for occasional use by grandchildren in our house. It is light weight and very compact. Not all booster seats fold like this one and easily fit on a closet shelf. Probably will have to purchase another one as we often have more than one grandchild over for dinner. Definitely recommend.,1

The Night Light Turtle was more than I expected. It gives enought light to make our child feel safe and the orange stars are very soothing. No more bathroom light in my eyes!!!,1
"Yes, scratchy! I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet. It feels like very cheap, low thread count material, not nearly as soft as most bedsheets. When my daugher used this sheet, she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head. It's possible, of course, that these were unrelated to the sheet. However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot. There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate. Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it! The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous. Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib. I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore. But, there is an upside. This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use. Snap, snap--that's it. There is no lifting the mattress. And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress. Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere. To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress. This sheet was perfect.",0
"This is probably the hardest to use baby tub, it is bulky and hard to use the shower with the newborn. the temp messure is barely legiable, and my baby hated it. My newborn kept sliding down and she barely fit length wise. She is 21inches long. I just used it for the first time before she went to bed and i am going to take it back asap. I think i will stick with the older style tubs.",0
"I love the Gerber line of baby washes, shampoos, and lotions. They smell so much better than the Johnson & Johnson or Baby Magic products. The Gerber lotion works so well that I use it on my hands as well as on my baby's entire body. The scents are soft and sweet, not too fragrant or overpowering. The products are also gentle, and the baby wash and shampoo do not irritate my baby's eyes. Of all of the baby bathing products that I have tried during the last year, these are definitely my favorite.",1
"This is a small sanitizer that works well to sterilize pacifiers and teething items, or other SMALL things your child may touch. It takes 30 minutes for one cycle to run, and uses dry heat, so you can sterilize small toys and things you would not put in a dishwasher or washing machine. It is not designed to sterilize bottles or bigger items.",1
"I've been using this wipe warmer for 4 months and have had no problem. When the wipes are emptied, I rinse out the little pad and leave it very damp and it works fine. I've never had a brown wipe yet. I find that if you keep the wipes as far down into the opening as possible, it keeps them warm for the next use. I use the Berkley and Jensen brand pop up's and they work great mostly because I think they are thinner than the huggies or pampers brand. I do have to keep a hand towel folded underneath just no moisture can get into the wood of the changing station.",1
My son loves this swing! He loves both swinging directions and to watch the fish spin and the center light up! Everyone that I know swears by this swing. It can be closed for easy moving from room to room. Fisher Price makes great products!,1
Saved my back and shoulders. I have friends who never used a pregnancy pillow who swear they didn't need one. I'm guessing that's because they never tried this pillow! The night I got it I slept for 14 hours. Highly recommend.,1
"Other reviews are right on the money for this gate. It's fairly inexpensive and not thick plastic, but it's perfect for ferrets. Mine are livid that they can no longer climb or squeeze past the gate, but I'm very happy. I'm a little worried it might not hold up over a long period of time, but I'd be glad to buy another of these as long as it lasts for a couple years.Follow-up: After several years this gate is still going strong. We are very pleased with it and would definitely buy another if we needed another.",1
"We purchased two of these for our 2 year old and 4 year old children. We liked the idea of having a bed rail that would be hidden away when company came over or just wanted it out of the way during the day.Pros - Once it is set up and placed under the mattress, it seems like it will do OK for our kids in their beds. We also like how long they are since they are running the length of a twin bed.Cons - These bed rails do NOT do a good job of ""hiding away"". The rails the guard slides into are very wobbly and come off the track very easily. If you attempt to hide it away, just expect you will be pulling the mattress up, and trying to figure out why / how it has come off the track. Then you get to play the ""Reassemble the guard rail"" game. This can also be very annoying when trying to change sheets, make up the bed, etc.I am also very disappointed at the hardware choices for putting it together. There really isn't anything keeping the canvas in place other than a couple of rods on the lower part of the canvas with some ""tension"" on them. No screws or plastic or anything of the like, just hope the canvas doesn't stretch over time, and all will be OK I suppose. I am 85% confident we will be replacing these over the next year, if we don't return them to the store first.Last one - Price stinks after seeing what it actually is. I think these rails should probably reside in a dollar store of some sort for about $10 tops. After buying 2, I sincerely feel they are not value add.",0
"Though this warmer generally works okay, I've found that I'd much rather just warm a bottle the old-fashioned way -- by immersing it in a glass of hot water. Dipping & spinning the bottle in hot water heats it much faster, and you know exactly how warm it's getting. With the steam heater, it's hard to get the exact right amount of water in there to heat a certain-sized bottle correctly. I ended up installing an Instant Hot water faucet (search ...for ""instant hot""), and while you have to be careful not to curdle the milk with too hot--too soon, even slowly heating the milk this way takes only 1-2 minutes for 4 oz. That 3-4 minute difference (manufacturer claims 5 mins to warm with this warmer) is pretty important when you're holding a hungry baby.",1
"I too had trouble with this stroller rolling. If I hadn't recycled the packaging, I would have returned this immediately, it cannot roll on grass at all. It cannot roll on packed gravel, I have to use the bar to get it over large bumps in the sidewalks.I think the worst thing is when I contacted the manufacturer, their response was, ""You didn't buy it here, we can't help you."" I was able to get it to roll over cement better by loosening the nuts holding the wheels on. If you are going to spring for a reversible stroller, I would look for one that rolls better. I regret selling my BOB Revolution to get this stroller. This stroller is just as bulky as the BOB and without the air filled wheels, is a piece of garbage.I just wish I could return it for something better because I can't imagine suffering through using it for 2+ years. I also had an issue with my Uppa Baby umbrella stroller that carries a 2 year warranty. They were amazing, are fixing the minor issues it has developed after almost two years and I couldn't be happier with them. I did find myself wishing I had purchased a new all around stroller from them.",0
"I cant stop laughing when my nephews and nieces are using it. And they also like, my niece keeps looking into the mirror and laughing. Cheap and funny gift. Ah, and it seems to have a good quality also, so don't worry about safety and health ;-)",1
"We've had this gate around our fireplace for 3 years. We have a large hearth and a wood stove insert, so a secure gate was a must. It is quite heavy, and has been very sturdy. The opening works well, and provides sufficient access to the fire. We cut it very close on the dimensions, so the gate was a little hard to install. All and all, this was a great purchase and well worth the money.",1
My little man would stand in the tub & play with the faucets. This fits perfectly & I was surprised by the fact that if you put soap down the trunk...it makes bubbles. We haven't tried that...yet.:),1
"I purchased this twice! The first one I bought had a spring pin (under the mattress) fail. So, I took it back and got another one because I loved the concept. My under 40 pound daughter fell out of bed because yet another spring pin failed under the mattress. When I went back to check on her later in the night, the rail had failed again, only my daugher had not fallen out of bed yet. If the product does not keep the child in bed, what is the point?",0
"This monitor has taken such a load off my mind! I had been toying with the idea of a video monitor for some time and finally decided to get one just before a big reunion held at my house. I am so glad I made the investment!When my 5 1/2 month old daughter was napping I could close her door to keep out all of the noise and still see her sleeping soundly. The portability is great! I was able to take it all around my house and out in the back yard with no problems.I'm usually pretty stingy with five star ratings, but this product deserves it because:- Portability - Great to clip on your pocket and go.- Reception - No problems, clear sound and picture.- Great Night Vision - We could see our little one clearly with only a small nightlight in her room.- Holds Charge - I used it all day and night checking the video regularly with no problems. And when the charge does run low, the sound still works well. You just plug in the adapter and the video returns to normal.If you are a bit of a worry-wart like me, I recommend investing in this product now! If I had done so earlier I would have been saved 5 1/2 months of peeking in on my little one.",1
"Lightweight, easy to manuever. Not much storage, though there is a cupholder. Umbrella is pointless, don't let it be a weighing factor.",0
"I think this is a must have for new moms! I always had it within arms reach those first few weeks; so nice for timing feeding and for knowing when I could take my pain medication. Once my baby was old enough I started feeding him on demand, so I didn't really need this anymore, although I do now use it to time how long he sleeps at night. I like that you can press a button for backlight, but sometimes I have to press the button several times before it works (that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but it's only $20, so it's well worth the money!",1
"I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often. What a waste!! The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective. You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent. In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous. The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof. They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.",0
This pewter baby cup comes quickly and makes a great gift. For the price it is a great value. I wouldn't have it shipped direct to give it a better presentation (packaging).,1
"the play tray comes in 2 parts and they don't secure very well. Our baby was using this, the tray fell out onto his feet and scared him off.I will not recommend this product to anyone",0
"Although they have a good reputation, they definately have a drawback. They are short and fat bottles, so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple. Now that my son is holding his own bottle, we don't use them for that fact-it's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple, he gets too frustrated. All in all I'd say buy a different bottle.",0
"I also was wary about buying such an inexpensive carseat. But sinceI have twins and needed 2 the price appealed to me. This is not my first experience with carseats my oldest child of course had the most expensive Britax roundabout cow print seat which I loved, but it just wasn't an option for me with a price tag close to $300.00. I bought these on clearance @ Target for $39.98! Yes the look is pretty blah, and there isn't a lot of padding, and the straps do twist. But overall I love these seats I have no problem getting the babies in & out and maybe more importantly we had no problem installing them correctly in our Mazda MPV which we did have problems with other more pricey seats.",1
"This potty makes a mess. After my son goes potty there is always a puddle of pee on the floor. We bought two pottys and they both leak. We are returning them. Plus the music only worked for one day. In addition to, this potty's music will not work if your child &quot;sits&quot; on the potty for a while. Do not buy this potty.",0
My wife loves this stool. She likes the ability to adjust the angle. Very easy to assemble just four screws.,1
"This stroller looks nice and seems sturdy, but I have discovered a lot of problems with it. At first, I thought we put it together wrong, but we double checked and it's correctly assembled. It's really wide and does not fit through store doorways or aisles. The seats are always reclined, even in the ""sitting up"" position. When I release the clip to lower the seat back, it maybe goes down an inch more. My sons are usually trying to pull themselves up to look around, then get frustrated that they can't, then they just try to climb out. So I end up pushing the stroller, carrying one son and walking the other. The cushioning is very thin, and there is a rounded support bar that can be felt underneath the fabric near the head area, and it seems VERY uncomfortable for my sons. Their heads definitely rest on that bar, so we put pillows/blankets under their heads. I am not a big fan of the huge sun visor, it is very large and not attached to the stroller very well. I think I would have preferred a jogger with two separate visors. On the plus side, it is easy to fold and very smooth riding - great for a quick jog, but not a great multi-purpose stroller.",0
The Sassy is better on both counts. It holds more food and the mesh is removable for easier cleaning and replacement.,1
"My daughter transitioned from swaddling into sleeping in a sleep sack. The ones we had were fleece from Carters and had sleeves. I wanted to get the same thing in a larger size, but no other sleep sacks had sleeves (and were reasonably priced). I bought the Halo SleepSack based on the good reviews, and I like them a lot. I was worried about them not having sleeves, but it hasn't been a problem. Since these are 100% cotton, they did shrink a little, but I bought a size larger in case of shrinkage and so it would last longer.The only complaint I have is that the zippers are upside down. They are designed that way, and I can see the appeal for night time diaper changes, but it makes it difficult to zip when my daughter moves around a lot.",1
I got this for my daughter for her twins. I had one like this when I had my kids nd it allowed me to feed them real food from the table instead of the junk from jars,1
"Pros: The weight limit is higher than most bassinets and pack and plays with the bassinet insert. Most of those only go up to 15lbs. This one is 30 I think. My baby weighed 8lbs 10oz. at birth. She was able to use it up to 8 months. It is very sturdy, not shaky at all. Well made. Even after she could't use it as a crib anymore, I took it with us when we traveled and she was able to sleep in it with it set up as play yard. She used it like this up to 2 years of age. The price is more affordable than most bassinets and play yards. It folds nicely, comes with case. Easy to clean and wipe down, etc.Con: the only con I could think of is that I could only find the sheet in stores that sold it. Like Babies R Us.",1
"I was very disappointed with this tub. The only reason I bought this was because of the shower feature. My son absolutely loved it! However, it stopped working after we used it only about 4 times. I thought maybe it was the batteries I changed them and cleaned the compartment where they go, but it still doesn't work. I called customer service and they said it was probably a kink in the hose, but it is as straight and smooth as ever. I tried everything to get it to work to no avail. I also have to put the sling back outside the tub so my son fits in the tub (he's only 2 months old) and it wobbles and slides around creating extra work. The sling has also started rusting even though I dry it completely off immediately after it's used. I should have just purchased the simple $15 tub, that's all this one is now.",0
"I bought the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light Turtle for her 2nd Christmas, when she was 18 months old. It has been on her dresser since then, and every night she will tell me she would like ""blue stars"" or ""green stars""...the amber stars are a little dim and create much light for her. It is the perfect way to tuck her into bed every night. She has loved and adored it, and we take it along to Granny's house when we visit. It's nice to bring something from home to help you sleep. It recently stopped working, but after almost five years, I feel like we got our money's worth. She might even get a new one for Christmas.",1
"My son, has ditched the high chair for this booster seat. He turns two years old this month and is able to get in and out of the booster seat himself. I think he loves his new found freedom. This is also perfect because now when we eat together, he feels part of the family as he is on the same level. I would highly recommend this item, absolutely no regrets. It was simple to assemble, is durable and easy to clean. Excellent!",1
"Baby loves her winkel. It is easy to grab and hold onto, the bright colors are very fun. This is a softer rubbery toy so it doesn't hurt if baby hits herself in the head - or throws the toy and hits someone/something else. This was a favorite around 6-9 months old, and is still enjoyed at 1 year.",1
"I'm in the process of choosing a waterproof mattress pad for my child's crib, so I was comparing this with several others around the internet and was surprised to read that this one contains polyurethane which, as it degrades over time (a process accelerated if it is exposed to sunlight through the nursery window), gives off toxic fumes that are unsafe for humans of all shapes and sizes. Other products containing polyurethane are sometimes used to strip wood floors and come with warnings about the toxic fumes given off by this chemical- not something you want to have around your baby all the time. They've included the polyurethane here, because it gives the product its waterproof quality, but it would be safer to look for a product that uses polyester for waterproofing, as many other brands do (though that material is highly flammable and not very breathable and there is no such thing as organic polyester or polyurethane because they are both petroleum byproducts). I'll be looking elsewhere, and I hope you will too.",0
"Really great pump. I researched various breast pumps for months and finally decided that this is what we needed. I breastfeed 99% of the time so I only occasionally pump. Mainly purchased this to mix breast milk into his food and have a bottle just in case something happened that I wasn't able to be there to feed him.Previous reviews I read said theirs squeaked, but mine never has. Also is really easy to take apart, clean and reassemble. Very comfortable and easy to use. People say their hands never hurt, which is mostly true, but after awhile my hand would get tired, however it wasn't that bad.",1
"I bought it for my daughter and the only complaint I had is that one of the ties was broken. but it was easy to fix and now works great! She loves the fact that it reaches the table. It was also great because it was weighted for her, some seats I found were only weighted to 30lbs and at three years old she is over that. She likes the colors and the pocka dots. It was a great buy!",1
"I had really high hopes for this product because I have used J&J skincare products my whole life and have used them on all 4 of my children, with great results. HOWEVER, within 60-90 minutes of applying the baby oil gel to my legs, arms and chest, I broke out in a horrible rash in these areas. 48 hours and two showers later, the rash is still there, still itching like crazy. It is beyond annoying. I have never had any kind of allergic reaction to any skin lotion/oil product so this is an unexpected outcome. I'm sure lots of people won't have any problem with this product. That said, I highly recommend patch testing this on a small area before using it all over your body or using it on small children. Also, the product instructions say that using it on wet skin is more effective than on dry skin. Well, my rash is most definitely worse where my skin was wet...probably because it soaked into my skin more deeply. Super.",0
"While this product did fit our Chico stroller that is on the smaller side fairly well, after two overseas trips it was significantly ripped and damaged beyond effective use.I have other JL Childress products that work well like the car seat bag, but this one product seemed to be off the mark.",0
"I thought this would be great but it turned out to be pointless. It changes color at a single degree so if it is purple the water appears to be too cold but one degree later, if it turns pink the water appears to be too hot. It is impossible to have the water stay at exactly the one degree that will make the disk stay half purple and half pink like the instruction suggest. We were much happier with the little yellow and green turtle thermometer that beeps if the water gets below or above a reasonable range.",0
"It's weird, but with some bottles they work and with others not. It's really a pity because the price is fair.",0
"We are very happy with this product. The booster is soft, yet durable and hods up great to our two year old. We also don't have to worry about the seat slipping as it stays in place perfectly. Very easy to clean too.",1
"I bought this gate for my dogs, in order to keep them separated while I am out. I read all the reviews first, and I was a bit concerned it would be hard to open and it may not be worth buying. The door may be a little uneasy to open, but this is the point, so whatever or whoever you do not want to open does not do it easily. You have to press the button and slide it a bit to open, and I never found much problem doing so (if you do, maybe while assembling, you did put too much pressure and make the door way too close to the gate)My door is a little small, though, and the gate makes it even narrower. So, accidents bumping into the metal edges were frequent in the beggining (I guess this is more my fault than the product`s).It is better (in my opinion) than the pedal (foot) one (i used it for a while), because it is set agains the wall, and the pressure keeps the door closed and adjusted. The pedal one always came out, because it doesnt have such system.Dont know if it would be that great for baby's parents, but I love it for my pooches.",0
"I bought this because I felt uncomfortable about electric pumps, and also because of its cost. I used a hospital-given free manual pump the first few days, and was pleasantly surprised by how superior the Avent was. The petal massager makes all the difference. I had letdown easily with the Avent, and my breasts were not sore, because I could control how much suction went into it. I decided to continue using it when I returned to work. I've now been pumping milk at work for five months, I get 4 oz in 15 minutes.Possibly, the electrical pumps are faster. But I don't really need to pump any faster than 4 oz/ 15 min. The soft Avent petal massager is gentle on the breasts. The Avent bag is nice and light too. If you think you'd be more comfortable being in control, this pump is definitely worth a try.Note: It takes time to get used to any breastpump, I think. Try the pump for a few days before giving up on it.",1
"Some background: My son won't latch. At all. So I have to pump exclusively, and that's awful when you can only make 10 oz a day! I did some research and found that hot compresses help milk production. I used warm washcloths and it didn't work. I ordered this product and at first use (after only 2 hours of not pumping) I was able to pump 4 oz in 15 minutes! I am now able to consistently pump 4 oz a session as compared to before, when I was pumping maybe 1.5 oz a session. They fit in my Medela pumping bra, too. I am SO PLEASED with this product!",1
"My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own. However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing. We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles. Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion. The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby. Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET! Pass on these...don't believe the hoopla.",1
"I began pumping by using an electric Medela rental pump from the local hospital. It was an excellent double pump, and I was not looking forward to returning it. However, I did not need such a heavy duty pump (at $45/month) for the few times a week that I pump. So, I began using the Avent Isis and love it. It is an excellent pump. I am able to pump both breasts with the single pump faster than with the double electric pump. It takes less than ten minutes to pump 6 ounces.The only drawback to this pump is that the assembly instructions are a little difficult to follow at first. But after you put it together a few times, it is really easy. I would definitely suggest this pump to anyone!",1
"I have been breast feeding/pumping for 5 1/2 months and was using a double, electric pump. I bought the Isis because of the small size for traveling and because of the good reviews it got.My advice for someone looking to buy it for travel - don't do it. It takes 45+ minutes to express from both sides because it's so slow. The silicone insert is extremely 'squeaky' and extremely annoying. I also felt like I was going to get carpal tunnel in my hands from the pumping action.I also had a very difficult time getting the suction quite right. I wanted to cry when I used it the first couple of times.",0
"I know people are saying they are having problems with theirs but i must say i don't have any problems with ours. we bought one and it is great there is no smell except when you open it to take the trash bag out of course. there are no expense to buying refill bags it takes any type of bag you have, and as long as you follow the instructions not to stick loose items in it, just diapers that are taped closed by there waist band then you should not have any problems.I did notice that when i was in the store buying ours i was playing with one that was sitting out and the rubber rim around the hole was not on right and it caused it not to turn so just make sure the rim is on right before you buy it, i fixed the one in the store so even if the rim is not on right it is fixable.",1
"I am sure that I would like the messenger bag, if that is what I received. Instead, I received the the Bumble Bags tote bag two times, despite my clarification with the returns customer service. If you want the messenger bag, order from a different service.",0
"I just returned this swing because it is not suitable for a newborn. When I put my son in it, he immediately fell to the side and almost had his head caught in between the bar and seat. It does not recline and has no head support whatsoever. And by the time he is able to hold his head up on his own, he would have outgrown the swing.....It is a very dangerous product, do not buy it!!!!",0
I feel like it could use some support on its sides so it doesn't fold in. Other tHan that... Great trash bag for my SUV.,1
"My son LOVED these wubbanubs. I had two... and I had them both for a LOOOONG time. I washed them by hand... and of course after a while, the pacifier ripped off, but then my son continued to use the toy b/c he was so used to having it around. He still has they ducky toy after 6 years (not the pacifier... don't panic.) Anyway, I ordered 3 for my new baby and I always gift these wubbanubs with rave reviews. (I never lost one and didn't have to buy a bizzillion pacifiers).",1
i bought this latch because i have a dog who loves to go threw the fridge and have a feast i got 4 of the latches and it did not work at all .... he popped then off within two seconds i even put crazy glue thinking maybe it would stick better the second time but i was so wrong he ripped them off without even trying do not get this product. such a waist of money....,0
"The little teething nub on this is so small. My son hardly ever put it in his mouth, he simply enjoyed shaking it like a rattle because it has little beads inside. I thought it was a cool idea, but it wasn't a hit like I had hoped...",0
"I purchased this product, based on the description it seemed like a very entertaining toy for my child. However, it comes without ANY instructions, and I had no clue on how to put water in the toy. It is not obvious and it is very frustrating. It is literally sitting on the counter collecting dust. I even went so far as to google the toy to determine if anyone else had the same problem. Someone suggested emerging the device in water in the bathtub. I did that and it didn't work.",0
"I found this gym at a garage sale, so did not pay full price, but my 3 month old loves the lights and music. I can finally put him down and something keeps him entertained for a bit.",1
"My son who is 16 mo. loves these Nuby ""No Leak"" cups....well they do leak when on thier side and the ""tear resistant"" nipples do tear. My son tore the plastic at the opening of the valve just from sucking on it. So not only did it spill everywhere but he also endned up getting to much fluid and either began to choke or wore what he was drinking. But they are great when you are switching over from a bottle and when they are teething.",0
When my daughter was born in 2005 we received the Mommy size Velboa Balnket and large AromaDoggy. My daughter is now 4 and STILL loves that blanket! We take it on airplanes and new places and it comforts her. The doggie is with all her toys....and she just loves it! The product shown is a miniature of what we got in 2005- and I bought this exact kit for a new baby of a clients'. THEY LOVE IT SO MUCH! I wish Amazon would offer the larger sizes...I could not find them! Bring them BACK please! :) They wash BEAUTIFULLY and the fabric is just heavenly for baby skin! Mommy also loves it! Blessings of Peace 2 u !,1
"My placenta is in the front so it has been very difficult to feel the baby move. However, when I used this product the baby actually kicked a few times which caused me to wonder if it was from irritation from the product since I never feel him move. The only heartbeat I have been able to find has been my own. I an 5 and 1/2 months have had no luck so far with this product.",0
"I don't know how many stars to give this item. I hesitate to even post this, because I can't stand it, personally, when people review things unrelated to the item that should be posted under seller reviews or similar. But as I have now ordered this breast pump TWICE from two different companies, and haven't received the item pictured, but have rather received the redesigned (and poorly reviewed!) Lansinoh Affinity Pump (you can see the reviews here: http://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Affinity-Double-Electric-Lavender/dp/B003B08EWM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=baby-products&qid;=1283971007&sr;=8-1), I feel that everyone needs to be made aware that this may happen to you as well. From what I can tell, this item is drop shipped directly from Lansinoh, and Lansinoh has just been sending out the Affinity for everyone who orders this product.Perhaps you will be able to find a seller who has stock of this item rather than it having been drop shipped, but I was unsuccessful. The second time I ordered it, I specifically ordered it from a company called AmericanRx because I was able to actually call them and ask if I would be receiving the one I wanted or if the would send me the Affinity instead, and they assured me that I would be getting the one I wanted. Now I have the Affinity in hand, and I'm going round and round with their customer service department in India, with them refusing to pay return shipping and telling me that they have no record of my call. (How could they have a record of my call? I called *before* I ordered the item). I have rarely felt so frustrated by a customer service experience or even just by trying to get the item that I actually want. Since I'm sure this item is frequently purchased --- it is one of the best reviewed on Amazon.com and certainly for the price you can't find a better reviewed item --- I just wanted to warn potential customers that unless you are able to verify that your item is not being drop shipped from Lansinoh and you're actually getting the item pictured, you're going to get their redesigned Affinity pump, which, again, has really crappy reviews compared to this item. So just be aware!",0
I have a very tricky 18month old who likes to stack things outside gates to make an escape - this gate has thwarted his attempts! It's a GREAT height where he can't try to open it. Total peace of mind! Really solid construction and super easy to install (although I didn't use the wall discs - those are a pain). Highly recommend!!,1
"I can't say enough good things about this pump. It's easy to use, clean and carry. This set is great and will be even more useful when I go back to work. I've never used an electric pump, but I don't see the point since I can pump at least 4 oz in under 15 minutes. Save your money and buy this pump.",1
"I bought this tub because my son was starting to resist reclining when I bathed him in the traditional plastic tube in the sink. It was time for him to move to the tub anyway - since his splashing and excitement was causing a waterfall down and all over our kitchen floor :)!When I tried to put my 5 1/2 month old son in this tub - he starting to first fidget, then cry, then scream. There is something about the angle of the tub that a baby his age was just not used to. Also it was extremely difficult to get his little legs in the leg holes provided. He was not happy once I finally got him there, after much crying, and after I had to contort his body to maneuver him into the seat. He is sitting up by himself - yet he was slouching once in the tub - he was not comfortable at all.I did like the parent ledge part of the tub. Although it was very difficult to turn and put in place on the ledge of the tub - but once it was in place- it felt nice to have a softer spot to lean on. But come to think of it - I could have just accomplished this by using a towel. And the location of the ledge is right next to the tub - I think it would have been better if it could somehow be angled diagonally in front of the tub - because I had to strain to get in the proper position to wash my son and to see his face.I am returning this and will look for something better - or I may just go back to using the basic plastic tub we have been using since day 1.***Please take a look at Consumer Reports January '05 issue on page 6. They specifically discuss this tub and it's dangers. How when the tub wall is wet - the seat has a tendancy to tip forward or backward and dislodge from the tub wall (where it is clamped) when little force is applied causing a drowning hazzard. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is recommending a set of revised voluntary industry safety standards for infant tubs, effective Feb 1st'05. This article states that this tub does not meet these standards (per Consumer Reports magazine.)I am para-phrasing what I read - so please check this out for yourself. Weird that I just saw the article the same day I returned the tub to the store!!!***",0
"This is a great stroller. It looks fantastic and the bamboo color is so fresh - works really well in the Californian climate. The seat on this stroller is so big that my 201b baby girl, almost disapears into it, she has so much space and loves not being all cramped up. She has room for lots of her toys and blankies to sit right next to her. I love the way the stroller also reclines almost flat, when she's asleep its like she's in a bed.Considering its a jogging stroller, it folds up pretty small and fits into the non-existant trunk of our Chevy Tahoe, we don't even have to remove the wheels. It's also pretty lightweight and a nice change from the heavy graco tour that I used to have.My son also pinched his finger badly after folding it but I have had no problems so I think you just need to be careful.I love the look of it and have lots of stroller envy.",1
"I purchased this item because my friend had showed me hers and looked like it would be a great travel potty. What i didn't see is that this ""on the go potty"" was extremely small. I would recommend the potette plus instead. Amazon was excellent about returning the item though.",1
"We have this swing. It worked for a couple of weeks, and now it wont swing and the mobile/dome doesnt work. This swing is a piece of junk. I have tried new batteries, it still didnt work.Also, the legs are unstable and when not sepearated completely to the max, the whole thing rocks as I push it. And I am not pushing it hard.I shouldnt even have to push it! Its a SWING its supposed to swing when turned on.How annoying.",0
"I smelled all the varieties of bar soaps at the store and LOVED this scent. If you like the smell of roses, this is wonderful! I found all the other scents too overpowering for me (peppermint, eucalyptus, lemon, etc.). I have a lot of skin allergies so I also bought the ""Unscented-Baby Mild"" just in case. But I end up always picking up the rose bar just because I like the smell so much. :-) Now if only they'll make a rose shampoo...",1

"We received the papasan chair as a gift--and we couldn't be happier with it. Our son really enjoys sitting in it while he is awake--he can be in a somewhat sitting position which allows him to see things around him. He also will sleep in it--particularly with the vibration going. He was small when he first came home (about 5 pounds), but has grown considerably (now over 11 pounds) and is still happy in the chair.",1
"These cups are GREAT because they are not the traditional spill-proof sippy cups that you find everywhere! THANK YOU First Years for making these as I haven't been able to find another good old fashioned sippy cup!! Yes a 'little' water comes out when the baby shakes it and bangs it around (it's really not that much), but she can actually USE them (she was using the other ones for teethers because she couldn't figure out how to get the liquid out). We have these and the Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 9 Ounces (which is a pretty fast flow for a little one)... Our 3 other brands are sitting on the shelf collecting dust!More pros:Great price! I don't have to worry about losing a pricey cup at play dates, etc...Top rack dishwasher safeCup, top, and stopper (there aren't a million pieces to clean)Also recommend: The First Years Take & Toss 5 Count Spill-Proof Trainer Sippy Cups with Removable Handles, 7 Ounce",1
I really love this breast pump.I bought this hoping to have a better experience with this than I had with previous electric pumps and it's been great. I have complete control over the intensity of the suction unlike the electric pumps which always had too much suction and were painful to use. I completely recommend this pump.,1
"I really was in love with this product until my next door neighbors started talking on their phone every night at my daughter's bedtime! We've had it about 3 months and for the past 4 weeks, we've been having this problem. The video turns to awful static as soon as they get a dial tone and I can hear their entire conversation from the first number they dial until they hang up! Of course I'm polite and turn off the monitor until I think they might be done talking, but it's almost as if I am on the phone with them too when I have it on! With only 2 channels to pick from, it's pretty much impossible to avoid this problem! It also picks up interference from truckers going by. The weird thing is that it doesn't pick up MY cordless phone conversations, even though my phone is a 2.4 Ghz model. If I had known interference was going to be this big of a problem I would not have purchased this product.",0
"This basket is just as beautiful as described. It is going to be for my daugher who is expecting her first child soon. I just know that she will love it, and it will come in very handy so that she can have her new baby close by.The bottom seems a little flimsy, but since she will not be carrying the baby in the basket, it will be just fine. I will be sure to mention this to her when she gets it. Thanks again.",1
"This is one of those products that can be terrific for some people and bad for others. My daughter didn't do well with it at all. It fit awkwardly, and she kept leaning and falling while using it, much more than without it. It got to the point where I felt that it was dangerous to keep trying, so I got rid of it. If you have any way of trying before buying, I'd suggest doing so-- maybe borrow one from a friend to see if your child takes to it.",0
"I saw a few packages of Huggies Snug & Dry diapers for a great deal, so even though I am a die-hard Luvs user, I decided to try them. After all, Huggies are more expensive, and thus are better diapers. Right?Wrong.Whenever my son had a messy diaper, the smell would seep through the Huggies diaper and into his clothes. Every time I changed his messy diaper, I'd have to change his pants as well, since the smell would not go away. Not only that, but the diapers had a damp feel to them, even though they hadn't leaked. I thought it must be a bad batch of diapers in the package. So once that package was gone, I tried another package of Huggies. Same thing. The smell seeped right through and had a cool, damp feel.Needless to say, I switched back to Luvs.***SIDE NOTE*** For those who don't like Huggies and are thinking about using Pampers because they are ""better"" than Luvs: Pampers and Luvs are identical diapers made by Proctor and Gamble. Pampers is sold as a ""premium"" diaper with a different design, Luvs is sold for less with a different design. Same diaper, just one brand name is costing you more!",0
I read all the reviews before buying this items and the product lives up to the expectations. The toys (Butterflies) could have been little more attractive and the swing could have been little less noisy. Even that noise soothes my baby to sleep :) I still have to figure how to open and close the toy bar without completly removing it.,1
"this is a fine barrier if you have medium sized dogs, to keep them out of rooms with wide openings. It adjusts fairly easily by screwing or unscrewing the poles on top and/or bottom and, since it is adjustable, fits uneven or non-parallel openings no problem, up to about 60"". the only ""problem"" is that it is NOT for you if you have difficulty climbing over (swinging your leg over) heights of about 25-30"" or so. once you put it in place, you won't want to keep removing it, as that is difficult if you have the tension tight enough to keep it in place.it does mark walls where the rubber caps are, mostly due to pressure. not a big deal if you intend to leave it in place.it does warp if opened all the way after it has been used in a shorter space and then it is a bit of a two person wrestling job to keep top and bottom straight enough to tension it into place.Overall, a good barrier, but not an opening gate. our three dogs cannot get thru it or tear it.i would not suggest it for pregnant women, people with joint issues or difficulty stretching or swinging your leg up and over a height. if you have a toddler on the other side of this barrier you will either have to climb over, or lift them over to get them out of the presumably enclosed space.",0
"We only use the glass bottles to warm drinks when needed, so I can't say much about the nipples. I only wish they make it shorter and wide neck (stubby style like avent wide neck bottles) because then it's easier to clean, but that's just personal preference. Overall, it does what it needs to especially as an alternative to the questionable plastic bottles.",1
"I recently bought this item in preowned excellent condition. I have a Jeep single jogging stroller that I love, and was excited to find this one, which had a similiar front swivel wheel. The colors (brown w/ orange and aqua accents) are appealing, much more so than other jogging strollers out there. I will say upfront, that I don't plan on jogging/running with this stroller, rather walking around the neighborhood, and other outdoor activities (like our upcoming Disney World trip). My kids are almost 4 and almost 2 years, both of average size for their age. My 4 year old's head is a little close to the top, but he fits just fine otherwise. I haven't experienced an issue with my kids leaning inwards into eachother like some of the other reviews mention. My kids actually like being side by side since they are used to being one in front of the other in our day to day double stroller. I'm pretty happy with this stroller, especially since I paid 1/2 the retail price since I purchased a pre-owned. It folds up pretty easily, I like that the front wheel can be locked (needed if ever going up or down steps), and it seems sturdy enough. I'm sure a BOB is much higher quality, but I didn't even consider spending that kind of money b/c I'm not sure how often I'll actually use this stroller. It's definitely NOT an everyday type of stroller! You will be disappointed if that's your intent. In my opinion, it's great for outdoor, or even in large indoor spaces, but beware- it's difficult to manuver through tight aisles/displays often found at smaller stores.Faults:1. The storage underneath is pretty useless since you can hardly access it (unless you literally bend all the way over to try to fish for whatever it is you need.2. No parent cup holders!3. No child trays/cup holders4. Quite wide, it does fit through my front door (yay!) but it's a really tight fit with some store doors.5. Sun canopy is pointless, as it hardly covers the childrens' heads.",1
"I tried using this over Dr. Smith's Diaper Rash cream since I thought it would be more gentle on the skin but our baby screams and cries seconds after this product is applied. There must be something irritating that causes pain. Once it is removed with a wet washcloth, he's back to being a happy baby again. I would recommend a different product if your baby has sensitive skin.",0
"This thing rocks. I put one on each side of the changing table. One side holds all the diaper supplies, saline & nasal aspirator and the lotion. The other end has the trash bags for the diaper pail and any odds and ends like the thermometer and covers. Really could not live without it. Truly a product that works as advertised.",1
"USED FOR BUMPER TO KEEP FROM DINGING MY CAR DOOR ON LOW WALL OF CARPORT. ADHERES WELL, LOTS OF CUSHION. PERFECT",1
"This is a great idea but with several problems. We bought the tub for our newborn and he loved it. However, now he is 10 weeks old, the tub is too small (our baby isn't very big).The folding mechanism is problematic on 2 counts:1. The baby can (and ours did) get fingers and/ or toes caught where the tub folds. This is scary for both the baby and parent and is potentially very dangerous. Thankfully our baby wasn't hurt, just frightened.2. Because of the way it folds, the tub can hold only a little water without it spilling out all over the floor. I don't mind this too much, but it does make bath time very messy and with a new baby, no-one needs anything extra to clean up.Because of the safety & size issues, we are searching for another tub and are disappointed that we wasted time and money on this one. Although it saves space, I would in future, buy an inflatable tub (which can also be used as a sled, apparently). PLEASE take extra care with your little one's fingers and toes if you buy this tub, but do think very carefully about other alternatives.",0
"We recieved this as a gift at a baby shower and I was tempted to take it back. I really should've followed my instinct.My 3.5 month old is not supported in this, and when I attempt to prop him with a blanket, the animals hit him in the head. To make matters worse, his head got caught between the white bar and the aquamarine bar and he was being hit in the head. This could lead to serious injury that I don't believe fisher price considered upon making this product.Save your money and go buy something else. It's not worth the risk of your baby being hurt",0
"I used the diaper genie for 2 weeks but had to throw it out. It DOES smell, especially when you're taking out a few days worth to throw away. Oh, the stench is awful. Plus you have to touch the wet smelly plastic to put into another garbage bag to throw out. I might as well have put it in a supermarket plastic bag to begin with. Just put it in, tie it up and toss away. A big waste of money!!! I can't say enough bad stuff about this nasty product.",0
"I was excited about this pump based on a presentation during my childbirth/breastfeeding class. I fell in love with it in the first few weeks of using it because its as comfortable as other reviewers said. Sadly, after using it for two months (2 times a week when I went to work) the motor gave out! Playtex replaced the motor at no charge only for it to burn out again in three months. After my one year warranty runs out in June, I'll most likely have to buy another pump. Stick with what's tried and true...Go Medela.",0
"New Mom, New at breastfeeding. Was beyond worried when after pumping for 20-30 minutes at a drip, drip, drip pace could only produce 2 oz.!!!!! turned the crank up as high as it would go and didn't get any extra milk, only an EXTREME soreness. the pace was maddening, especially since I'll be back at work soon. And there is this little flapper piece that often will not fit back in securely, thus making the suction not work at all. After calling the company, they explain it happens often and to fix it you have to boil that little piece all by itself and let it cool. I did this and it did fit back in, but I think it's a ridiculous inconvenience. the extra sleeves that fit onto bottle tops did not fit onto my bottles (airvent bottles) so that added ""convenience"" did not even apply.It is fairly quiet and the bag is discreet, probably the only pluses I'd give this product.After talking to a lactation consultant, she told me that it was taking so long because of the quality of this pump, and that I could possibly damage my nipples with it! She recommended medela as the best at the next cheapest price. In retrospect I should have known better, what a waste of 80.00! I'm going to ""bite the bullet"" and make the investment in the medela product and see how that goes.",0
I bought the round bassinet for my first grandchild and needed more than one sheet which came with it. These sheets weere not round but oval. My daughter kept them anyways to use but is not happy with them.,0
"I bought this when my baby was 6 months old and not stellar at sitting up. This is excellent for that awkward ""in-between"" stage when they are really too small for the cart seat but too big for the carrier anymore. She is now 14 months old and I still use it... I like the fact that you can use it on restaurant highchairs of all types as well as shopping carts. There are cheaper ones out there, but 4 out of 5 mothers in my mom's group bought the lower priced models and regretted it. If you think about the health of your baby and what you save in the long run limiting their exposure to carts that are never washed, I think you will be pleased with purchase.",1
This seat protector covers the seat very well and was easy to use. I will be buying more for my other cars.,1
"Be sure to purchase these in sets of 2 when ordering or be surprised like I was that there was only one shield in the package. I just assumed that they would come in a package of 2 since I don't know anyone who only breastfeeds out of one side, and would only need one shield. The description should be updated to reflect that it is a one piece shield and only one piece in the package as well. I was ordering extras for when I go back to work and ordered 3, thinking I would get 3 sets, i.e. 6 shields total. So now need to place another order to fix this misunderstanding on my part. Wanted to get the word out so that others don't make the same mistake as me. Other than that, these are a great product, they hold up very well as I have other ones that I have been using for the past 6 months without any issues at all.",0
"warm, durable, easy to zip, soft. we put our toddler to bed in it every night. the room can be cold but he sleeps well.",1
"We constantly travel by plane with our toddler and after he turned 2 I wanted his car seat on every trip - it is the safest and it helps keep him confined! We have the newer latch, (no screws) and it's so easy to get on and off. I never take it off at the security gate, just hand it over a couple of people ahead of us so they are done hand checking it by the time I get through. LOVE that it fits in the overhead compartment :) We still travel with our Maclaren (checked in a travel bag) once we get to our destination. If you need this troller INSTEAD of a stroller I would urge you to consider the go go babyz 4 wheel system w/ toddler adaptor. It's more $$$ but worth it, your little one's feet will be safely off the ground and you won't have to ""tilt"" back the handle all the time.",1
When my son was 5 weeks old we discovered the only way he'd sleep was on his belly. This made my husband and me very nervous b/c the current recommendation is to lay babies on their backs. We immediately went out to buy this monitor to give us the peace of mind we need while our son sleeps peacefully on his belly. It's been the best monitor we've purchased thus far (monitor #4). We've only had one false alarm (baby was in the corner of the crib). Sure we initally hated spending [the money] on a baby monitor but now we realize we'd do it again in a heartbeat.,1
"I LOVED these diapers---AT FIRST. They are very absorbant still. They are way, way less likely to leak or blow out than landfill diapers. However after 7 mos the first one we got doesn't fasten very well. The velcro has not held up. Sometimes when we lift my daughter up one side comes undone under her clothes. There is also lots of pilling next to the velcro, even though I always use the laundry tabs. It's ugly. Also, my tall baby is 9 months and 20 pounds, and we already have the diapers unsnapped to the biggest setting. I thought I was saving a lot of money getting these. especially since I would use them for the next baby, but now I don't think they will last until potty training. I got a few other brands to try, and so far I like the Happy Heinys One Size because it snaps out into a bigger size. There isn't a flap to keep the insert in the Happy Heinys, but it hasn't been a problem.I whole heartedly recommend cloth over landfill diapers. Just buy a few different kinds to try for a while instead of a TON of one kind that everyone likes. Most of the recommendations are from moms who have not been using them for very long.",0
"This seat makes bathing even the squirmiest baby quick and easy. It's mesh, so it's not uncomfortable for the baby like the other hard, plastic tubs out there. When pouring water on the baby, it drains right through the mesh. The seat dries fast, and doesn't grow mold or mildew.",1
"Put this in my doggy ""diaper pail"" over a month ago, and my super-sensitive nose is amazed at how well it works. Wish it had a self-mount.",1
I got this as a baby shower gift and I love it. It is easy to use especially with the little sling when my little one was a new born.,1
"Great product. We have been using this product for over 10 months now and it has lived up to all our expectations. Even though cleaning takes more time than other products, nothing is more important than the proper intake of nurishments. we highly recommend this products to all the would be parents.",1
"I've had these bottles for almost a year now and know everything about them.- They are solidly constructed of good materials and last- They are annoying clean because they have five parts and are difficult to disassemble.- They are annoying to assemble because they have five parts, and if you don't take care putting the bottle together just so...- They LEAK!If you don't get everything *just right* then the bottles LEAK. They leak upside down on the baby, right side up to leave rings on tables, and in general are just a total mess. Just think of how often you're going to be holding the baby in one hand and trying to assemble the bottle with the other hand, at 2am in the dark of night, with no sleep for the past week.",0
"I bought this bag because it looks great and seemed very comfortable. However, when I got it home and tried to pack it for my newborn I realized it just wouldn't work. The design is not well thought out at all...the bottle holders on the inside make it hard to organize and fit much of anything without having to stuff it all inside. And my baby's items are still VERY small! Also, I don't know about other bags but the changing pad on this one seems very narrow and short...again okay for a tiny infant but would not be useful for an older baby.",0
The material was made well but their suggestion for attaching it to the crib was useless. It fell off right away. Waste of money.,0
"So I bought this blanket with an Easter picnic in mind. Our church always has an Easter celebration at one of our members' farm and with a 15 month old I figured something to sit on would be great. I can't express my delight with this purchase enough. We purchased the red/grey and received so many complements. It was heavy enough that we didn't have to weigh down the corners, but when it was time to go the wet grass wiped right off and it folded up perfectly. What the picture doesn't show is that the ""fold"" seams are sewn so you can fold it up perfectly every time. It fit perfectly under the stroller and the built in handle was great after that.This has been one of my favorite, most versitile, purchases in a long time.",1
"I live in Ontario and I seen this bed online. So we took a day trip and went to the States to purchase this as you can not get this bed in Canada. We love it and the price.Babies R Us allowd us to open the box before we left, because if there was a problem with it, it would've been a pain to go across the border again. Luckily we did open the box, because one of the foot rails had a gauge in it.Setting it up 'definately' needs 2 people to do this. It is a royal pain in the butt with the rails that hold the mattress not fitting in as easy as it should. Add in a toddler trying to help, it doesn't make it easier. LoL. Took well over an hour to set up.Our son is 2.5 yrs and just learned to climb out of his crib. So we opted for a toddler bed, instead of a single regular size adult bed. Took 2 hours to put him to sleep, but he is really liking his new bed.It looks identical to his crib, but just now a 'bed'. The look, the style, the cost, you can't go wrong. Plus, you can use the crib mattress no problem as well. And using the same crib bedding, is even more of a plus as well.The bed can hold up to 50 pounds. With him now at 29 pounds, we have a long ways to go with this bed!! Plus its great for when his sister gets out of her crib, she can use it (totally gender neutral) and then it would be the right time to get him a proper big boy bed!!We didn't bother with the matching nighttable, what does a 2 yr old need a night table for anyways, besides, its not a 'forever' bed anyways, and when the time comes to get a big boy bed, we will get all the matching furniture then.He looks so darn cute in the bed, makes it a bittersweet moment, realizing how fast he is growing up!!Also, we had no problems crossing the border with the bed. We simply told them we bought a toddler bed, had the receipt ready to show, but they let us through no problems!!",0
I got this for my first baby and I loved it up until he grew too big. The hammock was perfect for his first bath and it fit in my kitchen sink perfectly. I loved that you could use it in 3 different stages.,1
"We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker. Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work. I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy. I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it. And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes. Other than that, I really like the walker! lol :} I think it will be better once we get a new toy.",0
"I am a big fan of their food so I bought a bottle of this when I ran out of my California Baby super Sensitive body wash. My 4 yr and 2 yr old started screaming and crying saying that it was burning their eyes. Please be careful with your babies. It does say ""For external use only"". Smells wonderful",0
"We used Huggies when my son was first born and he was constantly leaking through them. We had to change his clothes and sheets at every diaper change. We switched to Pampers Swaddlers and they are the best because they grow with your baby and expand. You don't have to worry that you are putting the diapers on too tight. However, I have heard parents who have baby girls that Huggies works well for them but everyone that I know that has a boy uses Pampers.",1
This is a great product for children or pets. I had one when my twins were young and I have used them for my pets too.,1
I bought this highchair for my grandchildren. It is easy to use and adjust and super easy to keep clean.,1
"My baby loved this, but the toy bar has a frog that moves and it broke right away. The gears got messed up or something and it began to make this loud clicking and grinding sound. This upset my baby and also upset me since I payed so much for this. I have since read other reviews that say theirs did this same thing, so it must be a flaw with the whole line of these and not just mine.",0
"These are not the cheapest bottles on the market so I was surprised to find that they leak constantly. I know that many reviewers have said that there is a specific way to assemble these bottles but in 4 months I have tried EVERYTHING and I still get leaks! After spending countless and painful hours pumping my breast milk it is very frustrating to have all of it pour out all over my daughter and me. Not to mention that these bottles have ruined many of me and my daughters' shirts and have permanently stained our couch. Another scenario that I continually face with these bottles is cleaning up formula or breast milk off of my walls and floors because sometimes they leak when I shake them for mixing purposes. Also, most of the time when I am running errands I have to run home to get more milk because the bottles leaked out half of my supply. Bottom line - you have to change your baby's clothes enough in one day without having to do so because of a leaky bottle. Save your sanity and clothing - go with a different brand!!P.S. I just bought all new Dr. Brown's bottles and they are wonderful!! My baby actually has less gas than with the Avent ones. They are harder to clean though.",0
"I have been very satisfied with Pampers with our child. The only thing I do get a little aggravated with is that the tabs don't stretch as much as other diapers do. We still use them though, because, they don't leak and smell great. I will still keep buying these for our child. :)",1
From my wife:This is the fourth diaper bag I've bought and it is the best by far. There are plenty of pockets where you need them and they are easily accessible with one hand. I love that I can have two hands free and it stays upright when I put it down. The bag is cute and the fabric is durable. It's a fantastic bag!,1
We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.,0
"I recently bought a Diaper Champ but will have to return it because the drum doesn't turn. The blue rubber seal snags every time on the white plastic and makes you really have to use a lot of force to turn the drum over to dispose of the diaper. I'm sure not every model is defective like ours is, but it is discouraging and I'm not sure I'll get another Champ to replace this one.",0
"I had registered for this tub b/c I thought it looked like it would be great. Once my baby was here, I found that it is not the best. The spray is way too gentle. It hardly takes the soap off of her. Also, the plastic part that holds the battery and water takes up way too much space if you put it in the tub where it is supposed to be.Also, now that she is almost 6 mos. old and can't sit up entirely by herself, we still need to use the sling. However, when she is lying down on the sling the tub is way too short for her body. Her legs have to be folded for her to have room. So now I have to look for a longer tub in order for her to have a comfortable bath.",0
"The suction cups on these bowls are no match for a toddler. They fail to stick, which defeats the purpose of buying the product. The bowls still work as unbreakable bowls, and the covers make them good for carrying food on trips if necessary, but if you're trying to thwart a little dumper, don't bother with these.",0
I at first bought two...then I realized that having two was not enough that the other blankets were too small and then shrank agian in the dryer. I loved these blankets and burp clothes that I buy them for all my friends who are having babies.,1
"I am 36 weeks pregnant, and have yet to hear anything from this monitor. At the drs office, the baby's heartbeat comes in loud and clear; with this all I hear is background noise. NOT worth it at all, I would have rather spent the money on something for the baby! Do not waste your money!",0
"I purchased this seat 3 weeks ago for my 8 month old son. After two weeks of using it I noticed brown flakes floating in the water when bathing my son with his two year old sibling. It took me a week to figure out that water was collecting between the seat and the base thus creating mold and bacteria. I was absolutely horrified! We used the older model of this seat with my 2 year old and never had this problem. I am amazed that the manufacturer did not consider this potential problem when designing this model. This seat is big, bulky, and potentially hazardous to your childs health. I would not reccomend this product to anyone!!",0
"These leak every single day! Please avoid and save yourself money, time, misery and agony.We committed the mistake of buying a big pack.",0
"My daughter loved this mobile so much that we hung the animals on the wall after she had outgrown having the mobile in her crib. We never had any problems with this mobile. I had heard great reviews about this product before my daughter was born, and we were definitely not disappointed. It was a great product for us. In fact, I am about to buy the remote control one for my son that is due in August.",1
"This was totally worthless. The thermometer didnt' work. The bulb syringe was too small and the hospital gave us a good one when we brought our baby home. I returne this right away. Invest in a good thermometer. We bought one for $ that can be used under the arm, in the mouth, or in the rectum and is quick and accurate and we needed the peace of mind that it gives us knowing it really works!",1
"i bought this thinking it would be so great. First of all it did not fit on the end of the crib so we had to put it on the back side and at the time we still had the matress up high, we thought that would work until in the middle of the night my baby rolled into it and turned it on! uhggggg what a nightmare. It woke me and both babies up ( dad slept thought it all of course ). So the next day I took it out of the crib and put it away. Now the boys are 11 months old and the matress is lowered so I put it up again. My other baby has the aquarium one in his crib and has a blast with it in the mornings and my other baby just stares at him because his toy is out of batteries. Also the aquarium one has little buttons that they can play with and the soother doesnt. So even when the other one is out of batteries it can still be played with.",0
"We love this gate so much I just bought our third one. We do not need the alarm option, but we have one at the marble entryway, one going into our kitchen, and now one at the top of our stairs. I will admit that the plastic mechanism did break on one of our gates. But, after a quick call to the manufacturer, they sent us the replacement, newly designed metal ones free of charge. They sent us enough for all of our gates. Each gate took about 30 minutes to install and the templates worked perfect. I don't know what was wrong with all of you out there that say your templates didn't work. We've used the same template on all three and it worked perfect the first time. I would refer all of my new Mom's and Dad's to purchase this gate without hesitation.",1
"My only complaint is that I did not realize that these pampers did not have the stretch in the waist. Otherwise, exactly what it says it is! Plus, free delivery. I was very happy.",1
This is so much better than the old door way jumpers. Those always worried me that the fixture would unfasten and get my child in the head and drop to floor. I wish this was available for all my kids. My third and final is blessed with a toy like this. She can sit in it for hours just bouncing and laughing. It gets the rest of the family laughing so she bounces even harder to get a reaction out of us. The toys on it also keep her amused and she loves the music it makes when she gets it bouncing. This is a must have toy people I can't stress that enough. Moms can get dusting and sweeping done while baby plays. Put this on registry as a must have!,1
This is a lifesaver!! Much better than the Diaper Genie and less expensive too. Contains smell extremely well and looks good too-much better than the Diaper Champ which is the first one I had. Excellent product.,1
Hi I bought this product and it is great if you are not asleep as long as you are awake you can here it but if you have a newborn and you need to wake up to feed them this will not help at all it is not loud enough and you will miss feeding your baby. Other than that it is a great product to keep you on tract.,0
The Pack N Play works well when my grandchild comes to visit. He loves the bug toys and the bright colors. I can take it anywhere. I am very satisfied with my purchase.,1
"1) It arrived more orange than the picture shows.2) The product description said that it fits most Kettler highchairs. The pad was much too big for our Kettler Futura highchair. It hung off of the seat where our child's feet could not use the foot rest.3) There were no straps to attach it to the chair.4) Feels like a patio chair cushion (the cheaper kind). Not that soft, but I suppose that's good for wiping off messes?",0
"Yes, yes, I read Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block, and yes, I believe that swaddling itself is the miracle-not this blanket. I had a few swaddlers from First YearsThe First Years Easy-Wrap Swaddler - Yellow(much cheaper and worked better), but my son outgrew them. So, I decided to try the Miracle Blanket. I wish I hadn't spent the money. First, the price is very high. Second, it's a long blanket that wraps--there are no closures (velcro, snaps, etc), so he tends to slip down into the blanket, and the arm flaps bunch up in his armpits (uncomfortable). What's worse, the blanket unravels and wraps around his neck. Scary! He gets very hot in this blanket (despite central A/C and ceiling fan--his back and neck are drenched!), and overheating is another risk factor for SIDS. Oh, and forget about ""quick"" middle-of-the-night diaper changes--it's nearly impossible to get his legs out of the bottom pouch, so wrestling him out of the blanket wakes him up. Overall, I would not recommend this blanket.",0
This is a great sturdy bag for traveling. My daughter's Chicco car seat fit perfectly and the bag was even strong enough to handle the baggage claims at the airport. The padding keep my daughter's car seat secure and clean. As for shipping I received the product in no time. I would recommend this bag to any mommy that have to carry their own child car seat when traveling.,1
We have this between her play room and the kitchen. Is a good solid gate. It is easy to open with one hand,1
"These were recommended by my pediatrician. My kids figured them out, broke them off the doors and I still have double sided stickies all over the house. Didn't work for us and my kids still over run the boundaries...however...now they are old enough to recognize natural consequences and parent administered consequences.",0
"This is a fine product and I am happy with it. I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad. My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag. My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning.",1
"I bought this car seat because it was supposed to be used for children up to 100 pounds and I thought it would be the last one I would need. My son is now 22 months old and he has outgrown the 5-point harness straps because they are not long enough and if he has a jacket on, I can't get them around him. He is too short and does not weigh enough for the shoulder belt system. It is adjusted at it's longest setting and it is too short. I had to buy a new car seat, I just got it in yesterday and it's 5-point harness system is so much better and fits kids until they are tall enough and weigh enough to go to the shoulder belt system. I now have a Graco seat and it is wonderful.",0
"I bought two for my 3 year old twin girls. These beds are easy to assemble, my husband assemble them,it took him less than an hour to assemble both beds. Beds look very nice and the girls love them.!!!",1
"I'm about to be a first-time mom, so I spent weeks and weeks researching different travel systems, reading reviews, etc. The big selling point for this one was the one-handed steering and folding. My boyfriend suffered an injury that rendered his left arm almost useless, so the one-handed operation is a big deal for us. And this product far exceeded our expectations. Assembly is a breeze. It took me fifteen minutes, while 34 weeks pregnant, to put it together. I love how sturdy it is! And it looks amazing!I've come to the conclusion that this system was designed specifically for parents with a disability similar to my boyfriend's. I've seen other travel systems in person, and was actually very concerned about how well he would be able to operate it on his own. Most travel systems have multiple latches and require both hands to operate. But my worries have been put to rest. Everything can be done with one hand. It even has a handle in the center of the console specifically for one-handed steering. I had my boyfriend test it out to make sure he could fold it, unfold it, and remove the car seat with one hand. It's so much easier than we anticipated. The only thing that absolutely requires two hands is adjusting the position of the handle on the car seat. That, I can understand. It's a safety issue, and leaving the handle up doesn't interfere with adjusting the umbrellas or anything, so it's not a big deal. Another reviewer said she calls this product ""the Cadillac,"" and I can totally see why. It just looks gorgeous! I would definitely recommend this to any new parent, but it's an absolute MUST for parents with disabilities. I have friends who have different brands of strollers, and you just can't beat the ease of operation with this one.It does have a couple of cons, although none of them are a big enough deal to affect the 5-star rating for me. First of all, it is large and takes up a lot of space, even when folded. It is also a bit heavy. However, I have a PT Cruiser, and it fits in the back of my car just fine. Even as heavy as it is, I can still lift it (I'm now 36 weeks pregnant) on my own to put it in and take it out of the car. My boyfriend can also lift it with one hand, and although it's a bit harder to maneuver the heavy stroller into the car with one hand, it can be done without too much headache. And I'd prefer something heavier and sturdier to something lighter and flimsier, anyway. Also, I've noticed other reviewers talk about how it doesn't stand on its own when folded. This is true, but a stand-alone feature wasn't on my list of priorities when buying a stroller, so I really couldn't care less whether it can stand on its own or whether we have to lay it down when folded. Again, an absolute MUST if you or your partner have a disability. But it's a gorgeous, sturdy, simple-to-use travel system for any parent. This is by far the best buy for the money.",1
"This is the best bed rail ever! I was a bit confused about the differences between this one and the Universal Safe Sleeper. The hinge on the Universal has been raised 1"" and that's the only difference. Oh, and $10 more.",1
"I can't resist writing another good review. This mobile keeps my child entertained for hours a day - and if she is fussy at all, immediately calms her down. We nick named the animals &quot;mono&quot;, &quot;pollo&quot;, and &quot;froggie&quot;. According to the instructions that come with the product, Bach is supposed to soothe the baby (which it does), while the other two are for playing while baby is active. The only thing that would make this mobile better is better volume control - it is pretty loud, and there is no &quot;mute&quot; button - so playing it for baby in the middle of the night is not really an option. By far the best toy of my daughter's 12 weeks of life!",1
"Our baby was born in December. We live in Colorado and wanted something to keep the wind and snow off her when outside. Thought Bundle Me was perfect solution.Looked cozy and convenient in pictures and in the store. Found it to be impractical and actually, unsafe. We have an Evenflo five-point restraint infant seat. The padding underneath was much too bulky casuing the harness straps to not fit properly. Tried and tried to get a good fit all to no avail. Returned this item and have since learned it is not recommended to have any bulky padding between child and car seat. Purchased a much more affordable car seat cover that just goes over the top. Works beautifully. Save your money and peace of mind. Don't buy this product.",0
"We had high hopes for this changing table as it had been rated high on Amazon & Target, but it did not live up to these expectations. The wood cracked/splintered off in several places and the screws were so light weight that they stripped and bent when my husband screwed them into the wood (and he wasn't even using an electric screwdriver). The one place where the wood cracked was at the screw hole and we had to go to the hardware store and buy an extra metal plate to try and hold the table together. It will be usable but doesn't look great with cracked wood and a big metal plate holding the leg together. We would have sent it back, but there's no way to un-assemble it since the heads of the screws are all stripped and there's no way to get them out. This is a very cheap product and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.",0
"I bought an eight-pack of these for my firstborn 13 years ago and I'm now using them on my second baby... talk about value! These are great, especially if you work outside the home like I did the first time around (I just had to wash them every night). Anyone can put them on your baby since they go on just like disposables. The fact that I was able to save them and can now reuse them after all these years blows my mind. I've heard great things about other brands but can't afford to try them out. So all I can say is that these are practical, useful, durable, and well-worth the initial expense. I soak them in either white vinegar or baking soda and hot water (vinegar is best for urine and baking soda is best for poop) before laundering for optimal cleanliness. I've never had either baby experience diaper rash while using these. With my first, I used one doubler and my son would last 3-4 hours before needing a change; my second son is a super-soaker so I use two doublers and a vinyl cover and check him after a couple of hours. Keep in mind that even with disposables you'll have more trouble with getting the right fit than with absorbency -- that's what Consumer Reports said in their most recent article and ratings report on disposable diapers. I've experienced blowouts and massive leakage with every brand of disposable diaper we've tried, and my second baby is quite a chunky boy, so I know CR is right. Some websites allow you to purchase a sampler package so you can try different brands of cloth diapers out and see what you like best; if I didn't have these already I probably would've tried that. Also, I would've probably bought the Ultras had they been available 13 years ago. Overall, the money saved by using these with both babies makes the initial cost seem like nothing. Plus, when you use cloth there's a higher likelihood of your child wanting to potty-train earlier (EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT AND THEIR MILESTONES WILL VARY).",1
"This product worked out very well for us - even though I had my reservations. It has a very strong hold - so my son can not just pull it off; it has three spots to hang toys - which we also like, and it does protect both - your child's head and teeth and your crib. So, all and all, I would recommend this product.",1
I found this product to be a waste of money. I can accomplish the same thing by running the bottle under hot tap water. It also takes forever to heat up the bottle and you have to constantly check on it or it will overheat the bottle. I also found the no on/off switch to be very inconvenient. We have forgotten to unplug it many times. If I had to do it over I wouldn't bother with this product.,0
"I liked this cup at first, but then it started leaking from the bottom. Evidently, over time, the plastic holders start pulling away from the actual bottle, creating a leak where they were once joined. At least we got about 4-5 months out of it first... Unless you want a ""disposable"" sippy cup, spend your money on a different product.",0
"We got this table from our registry to match the Emily crib. Wish I'd read the reviews more closely. The product at the time I added it to our registry was advertised as solid wood. It is full of MDF/Pressed wood with very little actual solid wood. The product description still does not state this.The table had several flaws in the production (missing holes for screws, etc). Upon following instructions exactly, it ended up having four cracks in it by the time we put it together. Totally flimsy. My husband and I debated returning it, but we'd spent so long putting it together that we decided against it. My advice would be to think twice, though. Its hard to come by a good changing table that is solid wood in this price range, so I'd suggest looking at something made of another product. With this table, you'll get an Ikea-quality product.",0
"We bought this pack n play after purchasing and returning an evenflo playard. We had one pack n play in the upstairs of our home from our first child and wanted a second one to have downstairs. The bassinet is quite sturdy, and all the pieces lock properly without to much effort. We didn't even need to use the instructions when setting it up. Plus it came with a mobile, a music station and a storage space for diapers and such. All in all a nice item, that can work for a girl or boy, definatley would recommend it!",1
"After using these bottles and trying to see the benefit in them, it still hasn't proved it's worth. I didn't mind cleaning them an extra few seconds, if only they had worked for my baby!With all the contraptions it comes with, you would think it works. I'm pretty sure there are other babies out there who have benefited from these and I'm happy for them, but I just was not happy that they still gave my son some violent gas pains! I have since switched to a simpler form of basically the same thing, and that is the Ventaire bottle! It has worked wonders for my son! I am disappointed that the Dr Browns bottles didn't work for us, wish they had...",0
I bought these as they claim to be 2 ounces each...the perfect size to feed my little one. I measured before making my first batch of baby food and found out they only hold one ounce. I am FURIOUS with the company - what if I hadn't measured and had thought I had been feeding my baby two ounces and it was only one ounce?,0
"This product is a life saver. No bulky strollers to deal with ... just a simple, easy frame to take the load off carrying a heavy infant seat carrier. I was afraid it would be overkill to have this AND a stroller but it is not. I keep this in my car at all times and use it when I go to a big building with a long walk from the parking deck or a department store, etc. I basically use it when a lot of walking is involved and there aren't shopping carts. It's GREAT.",1
"Purchased this to help keep track of multiple class projects and to hold documents while I type. Works well for sorting, and tucks away behind my computer screen when not actively in use. It is simple to insert documents into the holder, but this same simplicity allows documents to be easily knocked out. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It was inexpensive and it suits my needs.",1
"This is a great product! My files had been a mess, hand written (if at all). Now with a simple solution, I am neat and organized!",1
"I expected a bit more than was realized, having nothing but great experiences with Fluke equipment. I bought it to trace network cables and had no luck sorting out which was the target cable until I got to the termination. Even then the signal was faint. I suppose when I get more experience with it, I'll become more confident with it's behavior. Until then, I'll run other side-by side tests to verify my results",0

"This cabinet came in two flat boxes of sawdust, broken pieces of wood, cut particleboard and cardboard. The poorest quality cabinet I have ever seen and I have been to Wal-Mart once or twice. This is supposed to be a DVD ""safe"" safe? The cabinet was pressed sawdust with a cardboard backing nailed on. No where in the description does Spinkeeper tell you what materials are used to fabricate this cabinet. This cabinet is incredibly overpriced for pressed sawdust and cardboard along with a handful of nails and screws. Save your money and buy a real wood or metal cabinet. My unit is on its way back.",0
"I had mine for about a year, barely used, before it slowly got louder and louder. When I took it apart I noticed that it had plastic gears which were ground down to almost nothing.

As stated by previous reviews this is a junk phone. My old Panasonic 900mhz was great and worked for years after being dropped a number of times.This phone has a horrible battery life and the individuals on the other end of the line constantly complain about you being hard to hear.

I didnt want to order 500 of them, but a dozen is fine. I'm very happy that I finally have my clic stic bics!!!!!!!! LDC",0
"So many people have complained about short battery life, I felt it was necessary to post some basic information about the Ni-Cad batteries used by this phone:""Ni-Cad has a chemistry-related problem known as ""Memory Effect"", which limits the discharge capacity of the cell if it is not completely discharged during each use.""This means that in order to maximize the battery life, you need to:1) fully charge the battery for at least 15 hours before using handset for the first time (you only have to do this once)2) do NOT put the handset back in the cradle unless the battery is almost dead. This means putting the handset in the cradle ONLY WHEN NECESSARY for charging. The longer you can wait before recharging the batteries, the longer they will last.It really is a shame that panasonic didn't use another (better) battery type, but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy acceptable battery life... it just means you have to follow the two steps above. Once I got used to leaving the handset off the cradle, I realized it was much handier not feeling that I had to put the phone in the cradle all the time to ""top off"" the battery.For $30 (shipped, after $40 panasonic rebate), if you need a new cordless phone/answering system/caller ID box, this is a great deal and can't be beat!Edit: I've had the phone for 2 months now, and I still go over a week between charging the battery...(and that's using the phone daily!)",0
these showed up on time and fit exactly what we needed them to fit. there were no issues with the packaging,1
"I've had good luck using a variety of headsets with Skype, but wanted to see if I could free myself of having to put one on whenever someone calls. Unfortunately, I had little luck getting the MiniVox to work in an actual conversation. When I tried to record audio with, say, Audacity, the MiniVox sounded just fine, but as soon as I tried using it in a two-way conversation, my outgoing audio would be badly muted whenever I was receiving audio from the person I was talking to.So I tried a little experiment, and played music through the MiniVox while I tried to record some audio with Audacity. Sure enough, the record audio was chopped to pieces. I tried various settings, and even downloaded and used the MiniVox volume-setting software. No luck.Perhaps I've made some sort of cockpit error, and need to change my setup. But as things stand now, there's no way I can use this product with Skype.",0
"For years, this has been the only printer paper that I've used (to the point where I've been willing to drive 45 minutes from home just to get to the store where they used to sell it). I've tried many other brands, but it's amazing how yellow other papers look when you're used to dealing with 99% brightness. The 24-pound weight doesn't hurt, either -- documents printed on Navigator tend to have a bit more gravitas than documents printed on inferior-quality paper.Do yourself a favor -- if you're looking for quality printer paper at a reasonable price, go ahead and just buy this. You won't regret it.",1

"I would never recommend this product. It was ridiculously difficult to work, and took me about a month to become familiar with this pocket organizer. I find it much easier, faster, and much more simple to just use my phone to keep my contacts and appointments. The SHARP WIZARD OZ-290HII was not worth the money. After about a year now, using it on and off in month-long intervals, ONLY HALF OF THE SCREEN WORKS. I cannot understand, or see anything on it anymore. I checked to make sure it was not near any magnets, and I have never dropped it. I do not have kids, and I was the only one using the device. No one could have accidently, or purposely, done this. I tried replacing the batteries, and that was a failed attempt at reviving my pocket organizer. I am considering buying a new one, maybe a PDA instead. I would definitly spend more money elsewhere, than waste it on this terrible product.",0

"Very unhappy with item. Had power but would not work plus, Three Handset item was only Two Handset so what the heck",0
"We've had three of these phones for over 2 years now and just added this handset so we could intercom our teen in her bedroom. Adding the songs and photos to really make this your own is a bit time consuming but I love knowing who is on the line based on the song/rintone that is playing. Even without customizing, the caller ID works well. Sound is clear and range is great even with multiple other wireless gagets in the house. Phone is lightweight and handset is comfortable to hold (one of my first criteria in buying a phone). The answering machine is easy as well. We've had no issues with this phone and would purchase similar product again but really can't see where we'll have a need anytime soon. Also battery life is very good. We often leave these off the handset for 24 hrs or more and only once have we had one alert us to low battery.",1
"I need rigid photo mailers to send out paper products that absolutely CAN NOT be bent in the mail. When I tried to find something similar in a typical office store, I was disappointed. I'm really glad that I found these here for two reasons: The Price, and very specific. I felt like I was kinda taking a gamble here, because I can't see it in person and touch it to see if it was of a high quality. I'm really impressed with these mailers. I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5, because I am taking just one of the mailers and putting it through some abuse to see what would happen if I put it through very excessive damage (water, forcing to bend it in half, dropping it outside in mud and running it over with my car, ect). Basically things that wouldn't happen during transit. I will update this review when I get done trying to ruin it. I might even post pictures so that I can share how it will hold up to all of that. So far though, it does NOT bend easily and I'm very confident that these mailers would reach its destination unscathed. Just curious that's all :-)",0
"The bluetooth paring directly to my bluetooth enabled laptop, the laser pointer, and the powerpoint presentation interface work well. I even like the magnifier feature which has actually come in handy once or twice. It's also nice that it has an on/off switch to save on battery life, and the carrying case is nice to have since it gets tossed around in my laptop bag. I've had it for over a month now and use it almost daily and have had no problems with it. My only complaint is the build quality. The latch for the battery compartment is poorly designed and thus within the first 5 minutes of openning the package I was having to decide whether to return it or fix it. Had it not been for the low price I paid on Amazon I would likely have returned it. My solution was to cut a piece off of a wide rubber band and use it for its spring action for the battery cover latch, which has been working fine since then. I am pleased with my purchase, so I recommend the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 with one caveat about the build quality of the battery compartment latch. I would give it 3.5 stars.",1
"We have had one of the full size Rubbermaid carts for years and it has held up extremely well. I wanted a smaller cart to carry classroom materials from my office to the room. It works great, is super durable, and does not take an engineering degree to assemble. It steers well and rolls easily across different flooring and sidewalk materials.",1
"I would like this labeler, except for the fact that as so many others have noted, it prints out very wide margins around individual labels. Because of this, I always have to reach for a pair of scissors and trim the labels. Each and every time.

"This is my favorite all around pen. It's not too heavy for my purse but has a quality, balanced feel in my hand and a soft grip. It appears that Papermate has stopped making it because it's no longer in their product line up on their website, so if you like this pen too, stock up now!",1
"The design of these highlighters leaves something to be desired. Long and bulky, the barrel of the marker resembles (and feels in the hand) like one of those plastic tubes that cigars come in. There is no grip and that makes using these pens uncomfortable when trying to highlight with the small nib.Though filled with ""Smear Guard"" ink, I still found that they still can smear (but not terribly) over a variety of different kinds of pens I tried. (Gel, ballpoint, fountain pen ink...) It was worse if you went back and forth over the same area of writing - which you may have to do because the marker nibs are so thin.On thin paper, these highlighters bleed through. Some of the darker colors included in the set like the red, dark blue & magenta are too dark for use as a highlighter, but could be used for annotations.I did not find any difficulty or smearing when highlighting a sheet of paper printed with ink-jet inks, though i did not try on a freshly printed page.As I am a writer that frequently uses a fountain pen, I'd love to find something that I can regularly use with water based fountain pen inks. I had hopes for these, but I guess I will have to revert to using dry crayon type highlighters.",0
"These poly mailers are perfect for mailing first class items (like articles of clothing) that weigh 13 ounces or less.

"This is a great phone if you are just looking for a basic cordless. I've been very pleased with the reception quality and I like the simple, clean design without tacky, futuristic buttons that more recent models tend to have. There are a couple of things I did find annoying, however.- If your call requires a series of numbers (e.g. long distance call that has an access number followed by an actual phone number), you cannot browse the phonebook for subsequent numbers. You can still use the speed-dial feature, but you'd have to know where the desired number is stored.- The battery life is *way* too short.- The phone has this rather annoying beep for whenever any of the buttons is pressed, and there is no option to turn in off.",0

"DURABILITY.PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE.EXCELLENT LAYOUT....Durability...I am in the military and this thing IS my savior. I have taken this thing around the world with me, and in my pocket every day. It has a professional look to it while also being extremely durable (haven't ripped a single page yet and I've had it for 9 months). The pages don't fall out, and there's ample room to write lists and tasks. This thing has been spilled on, rolled up, folded, crushed, etc. And it still looks great and not a single page has fallen out!...Professional Appearance...While it's listed that this thing is 8"" x 10"", please keep in mind that's while it's open. Brand new, this thing is about 1/2"" inch thick. Closed, it fits perfectly in my uniform's cargo pocket. It has a a ""coat-hanger metal"" spiral spine and two black plastic/vinyl covers. The covers are textured and appear to be leather at a glance. I've received compliments on my planner and compliments because of my planner numerous times (ex: ""&lt;Name>, every time I see you, you are always doing something and are ready to take notes. I wish all of my troops were as organized as you. Where did you get your planner?"")...Excellent Layout...There are 2 layouts that come with this planner: The monthly view and weekly view. 1) The entire month is laid out when the planner is open (no bigger than a sheet of paper). Each day's box has 6 lines to write on, a note section on the side, and mini calendars on the side of the previous month and 2 months ahead. The calendar layout is AMAZING! 2) After the month lay-out, each week in the month is then layed out. Mon-friday have an area to write that's about as big as an index card, while sat/sun share an area the size of an index card.Also, every American/Canadian/Mexican holiday is included in the calendar, which is nice.The front of the planner has a course tracker (I do not need), while the back has studying/safety/security/job interview/resume/time management/how to find a summer job tips (they are actually pretty good), a grade tracker (which I used for finances...very useful), a numeric calendar, a time zone and area code map, and finally an important numbers section.",1

This proved to be an annoyance, and a flaw which I would not expect from a quality pen such as Cross.However, today, when I went to use it, I discovered the nib assembly has completely unscrewed from the barrel, and is now lodged inside the cap. I'm sending it back to Cross. Although their guanantee states FREE replacement, their website talks about a ""processing fee"". When a manufacturer produces a faulty product, I don't expect to pay a processing fee to get them to honor their guanantee.",0
I purchased this phone a month ago. I am not going to give the things I like about it because it would be a repeat of all the raves in the 4 and 5 star reviews here. I just learned today how to get it to send my Skypein number to the people I called for their caller id (I was under the impression that Skype caller id wasn't available in the USA). I have used the handset in my camper. That sends the signal though 3 walls of the house and the aluminum camper. I used it while I was in the garden today. Thats 1 wall and 150 feet away from the base. When I ordered the phone I was switching to cable from dsl and I had a lot of modem problems. The phone voicemail worked great when the system was down. I turned off my home phone yesterday and will save about 600 bucks this year (my cell phones are for backup).I had one problem with the phone. Once it locked in restart (not sure if it was phone or router). I unplugged the unit connected to the router and plugged it back in. No more problems. I would like for the phone to be larger and heavier (more like a regular phone). I would also like to find another handset. I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat. I highly recommend it.,0

"I have been looking for a replacement for my HP15c (Best calculator ever made!). I have searched ebay for over a year and came to the conclusion I did not want to pay $200+ for a replacement. I also bought a 32sII RPN... great RPN also...but of course...they discontinued that one... so again to buy on ebay was big $$$. I finally found the hp 33s. I am glad to find a calculator for under $50 that does RPN. It meets my need for standard engineering calculations. Does not feel cheap. Buttons of good quality. But still miss my 15c! Liked the HP 33s so much, I am going to order a second one .... since they will probably discontinue... and the price will go up again. I have not ventured into the graphing calculators... don't need that level of calculations. My son has one and loves it. Some day I will pay $100+ and give it a try.... But it is not RPN!!!! So for those from the early 80's who loved the HP15C...give this one a try... it is worth it!",1

The pencils were okay but the erasable part not so much. They don't erase fully and leave some marks still on the paper. I would not purchase these.,0
"I have read the reviews in amazon.com and I have been wanting it for quite a while. When I saw it in one of those club store, I had to have it. I haven't tried very heavy load yet. I believe 150 lbs capacity seems realistic. Folding, unfolding can't be any simpler and easier. One thing I noticed, when I put a low profile heavy object, in this case 5 gallon water jug, I have to lean the handle very low or the weight of the load won't be directly on the wheel. Some kind of platform may work like a empty crate or box, but I haven't tried it yet. If you already have cargo tall enough like in the photo shown, it'll balance itself much easier.*update* (May-11-11)I had a opportunity to try the Max capacity test, 3 bags of pea gravel(50 lbs. each)First I put 3 together. It didn't lift without risking the base plate snaps off. The handle started to flex more than it should.Putting 2 bags together, little better than 3 bags on it but I didn't want to find out if it will lift or break.Putting 1 bag, it lifted without the handle flexing too much.I think 150 lbs Max capacity can be achieved only if the whole load is supported by both base plate and the handle. If the load is supported by only the base plate, even at the half the Max capacity can snap off the base plate. In order to move a 150 lbs. object, it has to be tall enough to lean against the handle, so the weight is distributed evenly between the base plate and the handle.",1
"I was very excited about this product, given the good reviews. However, I found that refilling the pencil took so much force that I was afraid I'd break it. Even worse, the eraser is useless, due both to the design and the material. If I could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better, this would be a much better product. If I have to carry this plus a separate eraser, it's not really saving me much.Oh, and the highlighter isn't a marker. Maybe I'm stupid, but I assumed it would be. It's just an orange ink pen, which is not the same as any other highlighter I'd choose to use.",0
I added this phone to my system. It was easy to program and works great....,1
"This is a great phone system. 2 lines, up to 8 handsets, voice mail, intercom, conference calls, etc, etc. So why 1 star? When it breaks, you're SOL.I've had my system for 4 years. Had a few minor problems, Siemens tech support helped, replacing a defective handset in the first few months. I was happy.All of a sudden, 3 months ago, all the handsets started having intermittent problems where the sound was garbled, in a digital sort of way (no static, just parts of conversation coming in and out a few times per second). I contacted Siemens, and their response was &quot;mechanical problem with handsets, we won't fix it, buy new ones&quot;. Huh? Mechanical problems, like you get when you drop a handset? But this problem started on all handsets, at once, and is intermittent. Doesn't sound like a mechanical problem, in the handsets or the base. More likely it is a problem with the firmware in the base unit.Talking a bit more to Siemens, I find that I can't just buy a new (8825) base unit, because the handsets I have aren't compatible. Great - so I have two choices:1. Buy a refurbished base ($130), and perhaps get the same problem 6 months from now, 'cause the firmware is likely the same, and Siemens will continue to insist the problem is a mechanical problem in the handsets. In 6 months, tech support for 2420 will probably be worse than it is now, and if refurbed units aren't available, I'm SOL.2. Buy a new base and handsets ($500). Since Siemens hasn't even admitted a fault with their 2420, how can I have confidence that they fixed the problems with the 8825? And if there is a problem, I'll get the same lousy support and incompatibility once the 16300 (successor to 8825 - just guessing on the number) comes out.I picked door #3. Goodbye.",0
"good quality cardstock, good brandname, better price. Arrived quickly and was packaged well. Darn these minimum word requirements for reviews anyway.",1
"This phone started out good, but the battery life went bad quickly. Had to replace a couple of the batteries on different handsets and they did not last very long either. The buttons do go after about a year. It gets to the point where you cannot turn the phone off and you have to remove the battery to stop the call. Between the batteries always dieing and the buttons sticking it was very frustrating to not be able to find a working phone in the house!!",0
"This sticky tack is not very sticky. It sticks the the walls great, but only until you attach a piece of paper to it. The paper rarely stays up! About half the time, there is blue residue left on the wall where the tack was. I do not recommend using this product.",0

I am sorry I bought this product. I installed it with updated drivers as other reviews stated to do. It made calls as long as I called directly from the Skype application on the computer. No matter what I tried would allow for the phone connected to the hub to make calls. The point of this device was to get away from the computer but that doesn't seem possible.Instead I have tried the Ooma system. It cost a pretty penny to purchase it but it is working like a charm. I figure after a years service it has paid for itself since the cost of the hub is my yearly phone bill. The added advantage is I can turn off my computer and still make calls. I no longer have a land line and just use Ooma. I use Skype for overseas calls but Ooma for everything else.,1

"I bought this phone less then a year ago and when I first began to use this phone it worked perfect, I could even use the phone untill the end of my street. I could go to the neighbors house and use my own phone, I could go get the mail, and there was no static at all, I could hear perfectly. Then not even a month with my new phone and I started noticing static when I would go to far from the base (like 2 houses over) which was never a problem previously. It just kept on getting worse. And know less than a year from when I purchased the phone, it is totally worthless! The buttons barely work and to dial some of the numbers I have to push extremely hard. Everytime I step outside to get the mail or even just walking to my driveway, the static gets so bad that I can't even here the person on the other line. Then I have to hurry up to get closer to the base of the phone. It was a great phone when I first got it, so if you tend to buy a new phone every three months or so, then this is a good phone but it just doesn't last. So if you want a phone that will work great for long period than I don't recommend this phone, because this is not that kind of phone.I hope that my review helped anyone that may be considering this phone",0
"If you are looking for a small camera this is not for you. We purchased several for my daughters 10th birthday party. The girls all loved the idea of having a camera and we used them in a fun game. They were able to get 18 viewable pictures. The packaging says that you can get 200, but when we adjusted the quality to get more pictures most were so blurry they were unviewable and several came out as just colored static. Many of the cameras (we bought 10) did not center properly so the girls were getting just the top of someones head and inside unless the light was really bright the pictures were not clear. The camera was also much smaller than I had expected. I guess I should have looked more closely at the specs. It is about 1 x 2 inches.However all of that said, the girls had a good time and the cameras are pretty cheap for a toy. It did come with the necessary cable and software, so no additional purchases were necessary. And at the 18 picture level (factory setting) the pictures were not horrible for a kids camera. The girls loved that they come in silver, green, or blueDo not use this camera to take family pictures or anything that you really care about, but a kid would surely enjoy taking this camera to the park, a school field trip, or out to play with friends.",0

"I have to agree with everyone else on the reception...i constantly have clicking sounds and 'white noise.' If an appliance is on (such as the microwave), the noise is unbearable. Also, I usually have to pick up the other handset after 30-40mins of a conversation because the low battery signal will start beeping in. Very, very annoying.

Never have had to change batteries. Good sound quality, not as good on speaker phone, but sp is great for waiting on hold, which we all enjoy. Even allows me to screen my calls.",1
"I bought the Panasonic KX-TS600W phone as a replacement for a similar, but 20+ year old speakerphone (without Caller ID). I figured it would be nice to have the Caller ID function built in. Well, I should have read the reviews first. The device does not have a port to connect a ""wall wart"" power supply, and runs off 3 ""AA"" batteries. Not only does the caller ID display run off the batteries, but you also cannot enter the ""speakerphone"" mode without batteries. But while the instructions claim you get 6 months of battery life, in practice I get 3 weeks or so at best with good Alkaline-type batteries. Since I am an experienced electronics technician, I was able to make a measurement of the current draw upon the batteries: 5 MilliAmps. At that draw, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you have drawn about 840 mAh per week.... you do the math, you would not get more than about 3-4 weeks on typical 2500-3000 mAh capacity Alkaline batteries at that rate. So I wrote a letter to the new Chairman and CEO of Panasonic Corporation of North America, Joseph M. Taylor. He referred my letter to a liason, Steven Robinson (551-482-8024). Mr. Robinson has been extremely helpful, and even sent me a new phone that was supposedly ""modified"" so it would run as advertised (6 months) on batteries. But I measured the current draw, and it also draws 5 MilliAmps, so it actually has the same problem despite whatever modification was done. We are still in limbo, and in my opinion every customer who has experienced this problem should contact Mr. Robinson and let him know that Panasonic has falsely advertised a 6 month battery life (and that 3 weeks is not reasonable battery life, you'd spend about $75 a year on approximately 52 batteries a year to keep a $30 phone running, pretty ridiculous!). My older (20 years) Panasonic speakerphone does not have an LCD display, but uses batteries to backup the programmed ""speed dial"" numbers, and the batteries last about 1-2 years. Panasonic should have designed this phone better, so that it runs either from the power of the phone line or alternately via a ""wall wart"" external power supply if absolutely necessary. Call Mr. Robinson, state your case. Maybe together we can all get a good resolution to this problem!",0
"I have never placed a product review before - but this is one of those products where I would NEVER buy again. The sound quality is horrendous. We have done everything thinking maybe it was our phone line so we replaced inside wires, outlets, etc. Another phone works perfectly but this one you can barely hear over the terrible static. Avoid.",0

"You can use this tape just about anywhere, even on wood surfaces, as long as you don't mind the fact that it looks like tin foil. The main purpose is for sealing air ducts, which it is very good for, but it is a good all-purpose tape to keep around the house as well. Better than gorilla tape in my opinion, because the adhesive on it will succumb to heat and come off, this kind won't. Maybe the only thing better than this would be the super-sticky foil tape that is for leak repair (looks like chewing gum almost underneath when you try to pull it off).",1

"I've used these to print a few sheets of return-address labels, and I really like them.Ease of peel: Almost perfect. They do come off easily, but not so easily I can bend the paper back and get 10 off at once. For single-label removing it's great. Tearing off the side leaves a tiny bit of each label free, enough for you to grab so you don't have to scrape off every label.Look: I love how they are translucent. The ink stands out nice and sharp, and the address seems more clear. It looks professional and pretty.Printing: (HP LaserJet) No problems. I was surprised at how crisp the ink was, and how there was no smudging right after it came off the printer. (I'm used to getting ink on my fingers.) Also, using the 'Mailing Labels' 'US Letter Small' presets printing from Address Book (on a Mac) the labels were all printed right (makes my life easier).Price: There are labels you can get for half the price. If you do a lot of printing these may not be economical. But if it's for rather infrequent use, I favor the performance and look of these labels over saving a few dollars.I recommend giving them a try.",1
"Purchased this to use in my Canon MP 830 color printer. Using Canon brand colored ink. Printing full-color, photographic quality inserts for CDs.

Destroyed several beautifully labeled and burned CDs, and their jewel cases, in the process. Bought three packages of this stuff, which is now hitting the circular file. Never again.",0

"I've owned this product for several months now and I did one unit software upgrade to ver 2.4.1. The software crashes quite frequently upon initialization. I had to contact support directly and I was told that this is a known problem and that I should roll back to ver 2.3.1 for better software stability. Sad to say, the older version is not much better.The Miglia website is totally useless, and if you try and locate software updates via the support link, you will be going in circles and not getting the information you are seeking. When I did get to speak to support about returning a defective unit(which they took care of in a timely manor), I told them about the issue back around August 1, and almost a month later, nothing has been done.This is a sad reflection on how much they care about the customer and I really doubt they are doing anything to improve their support website and/or the stability of their unit software for the Tvmini HD.Save yourself some grief and stay away from this product!!!This is purely an issue with Miglia/Elgato and not Amazon. I have bought other items from Amazon and have had complete satisfaction.",0
"Nice design on the unit. Set up was a breeze. The sound quality lacks clarity and gets a ""3"" out of 5. I really like the ability to set the unit on my desk at an angle rather than flat.",1
"Our typical document sizes are 20-200 pages with small runs (we use spiral rather than pro-click bindings for large documents), at relatively low frequency, so we couldn't justify spending thousands of dollars for a professional hole punch machine.This device is rated at 12 pages, frequently we have to cut that to 5 because sheets don't feed easily into the punch area. So you insert, if they don't go all the way in (you can feel the page margins bending), you pull out and slide in fewer pages, and shake the sheets a bit until they seat properly. It's very time consuming. I think there may be small shreds of paper at the punch holes that new sheets get caught on, or the hole punch surface area is uneven.Once the paper is in, it punches fairly cleanly, but pushing down on the handle feels like you're squashing a sack of potatoes, and the lever doesn't always travel the same distance, occasionally making peculiar cracking noises. Not a functional issue, just thought you'd like to know.Finally, this is a device that is designed specifically to put holes evenly along an edge of paper. But there are no longitudinal paper guides. So whether it's 8.5x11 or any other size, you're never quite sure if the sheets are all the way in and whether they're in straight. Over the course of using this thing, we've probably thrown a full ream of paper into the trash because the holes were punched at an angle or on the edge altogether (leaving a toothy line of half-moons on the edge). So then it's back to printing extra sheets, or even rebinding the document if you didn't notice the misalignment right away.The binding tool mounted on the top is marginally useful. Our device arrived with a bent slide on the top, so you can set up the comb and insert sheets, but we have to squeeze the comb closed by hand (which works just fine.) Perhaps others will find the slider-thingy more useful.I'd rate the entire contraption a ""one"" but, to be fair, it DOES work and it's reasonably durable and well manufactured (albeit with a quirky design). And the finished pro-click product looks very good.My next purchase will probalby be a different brand of punch with same hole pattern.",0
These notebooks are really popular for some reason and I do not understand it. The paper quality is very inconsistent and they are expensive for the quality. I have had two of these things and one had relatively smooth paper and one had horrible paper. If you write with a fountain pen this paper definitely is not for you. The ink with bleed and feather.If you want a nice notebook look into Rhodia and Clairefontaine...their paper quality is consistent and just about the highest quality writing paper you can find.,0
"My parents purchased this phone for us for Christmas last year. My dad is an electronics king, and loves to research to find the &quot;best&quot; of everything. Well, he was misled on this phone. There was always background noise, we could never hear the people we were talking to, and they could never hear us well.Also, the answering machine wouldn't stop playing unless we answered this phone. If we picked up any of the others in the house, it would keep playing.We finally just bought the cheaper 2.4 model ourselves and unplugged this phone and answering machine. Now it just sits here and looks pretty for when the parents come over. I definitely don't recommend it. I feel bad that they paid so much for it and it turned out to be such a bad system.",0

"This is an excellent calculator, particularly for engineering functions that require polar-rectangular conversions, where it solidly trounces even the TI-89 Titanium for convenience. Its two-line display is not as nice as the TI's larger screen, of course, but works really well, allowing you to enter complex calculations and edit them as needed, even remembering your previous calculations.The calculator has solar cell, so power is not an issue. With its plastic cover, it has been very durable over the last year and a half of being tossed into a backpack and used in all sorts of locations and situations. And at around $15 it's truly a bargain. It was recommended to the class by an engineering professor and I've used it college classes ever since; I bought another for my teen-ager to use in high-school math classes.The only thing close to a downside is that the ""manual"" consists of a fold-out poster of small-print explanations for various functions -- not comprehensive and occasionally incomprehensible. However, most of the calculator's functions are quite straight-forward, so this is a fairly trivial issue.I highly recommend this little gem of a calculator. What it does, it does well, and gives minimal fuss during the process.",1

I bought a bunch of these phones because I was happy with the previous model but be warned that they do NOT support callerid. I just assumed they would because the previous model did. I can't believe they can make a phone with this large of a display and charge $100 for a phone that doesn't support callerid. I am very disappointed.,0
"I waited and waited for this phone to come out. I wanted to use at home so the hotspot features mean nothing to me. The phone looks great. It setup really fast and started working in minutes. The screen and menus look great. However... The echo is HORRIBLE! It's not a software or Skype issue, it's a design flaw in the phone. The earpiece volume is so low you have to crank it up to full to be able to hear the caller. The mic is very sensitive and not insulated from the earpiece internally so you get this tremendously loud and annoying echo. Do some searching on the Skype forums to verify this known issue. You'll get the exact same problem with SMC phone (it's the same phone) so don't bother with that one either.Also the keypad is cheap. My daughter has a toy phone with better buttons. Plus it randomly (seemingly) connects and disconnects from the network. I have the new Belkin N MIMO router and a -very strong- signal through my whole house so I see no reason for the connect/disconnect issue.I wanted soooo badly for this phone to work. It just doesn't. I'm returning mine today. Please don't waste your money.",0

First things first: my only complaint about these badges/stickers is that they are *huge*. I understand this is so that a company or a person could print them out with more than just a name (such as the company logo above the name) but as I used them for a social get together they were just...too big.I also wrote on them with a Sharpie rather than printing. The ink dried quickly; there was no bleeding/smudging.The material is definitely more flexible than the old-school name stickers that were more of a paper substance rather than the sort of rubber/plastic/paper combo that these badges are made of.It's also nice that you can either peel the sticker directly off the sheet or punch it out with the back still attached. Great for when people want to write up their own name badge on the spot.,0
"I like it. It's simple, inexpensive, no battery backup, but with enough bells and whistles to do the basic job. Worked fine right out of the box.",1
"This model worked well two times, laminating business card sized items using 5mil plastic. I cleaned the roller after each pass using Fellowes cleaning paper as directed. The third time, using 3mil plastic the item jammed in the roller where it is stuck forever. Don't buy this model. I recommend spending a little more and purchase a full size laminator, which can be opened to clean the rollers and remove jams.",0
"fairly high-gloss finish that works well with shots to be framed. a bit lighter in paper weight thatn some of the premium papers, but nice for the price",1
You get what you pay for and it wasn't worth a $100.00. For a couple bucks more I could have bought a quality HON steel cabinet.,1
"We are extremely pleased with this notebook platform. It has a perfect angle and height, the lip is just right to hold it in place, it's light and not bulky, but sturdy and comfortable on your lap. It'll help protect the laptop when it's in it's case. We even use the laptop on it on the table because the angle is so nice. We have no complaints about this at all, very nice product.",1
"I have been using certificates in my business for years, and have never had a problem with them jamming in the printer until I purchased this product. I have been buying the Geographics brand for years, so I do not know why I am having such trouble with these.",0
"I like this product so much I bought two, one for my office desk and another to use at the kitchen counter.I use it with a 15"" Mac laptop. It lifts it and keeps it cool, protecting both the desk/counter and the machine. A great feature is the swivel, which allows me turn the laptop to enable another person to see the screen.",1
"This is the second Cramer kik step rolling step stool I've purchased. I used my original one in my walk-in pantry; but after a while, every time I needed it , it was either upstairs or in the garage workshop. I guess the guys liked it as much as I did. I decided to let them have it and get a second one for myself. One of the features I especially like is the safety of it. It has wheels so that it can be easily wheeled around, but once you step on it the springs compress and it is solidly held in place by a band of rubber that touches the floor. It also has a double step that is very convenient to use, and especially nice for short people like myself.",1
Very nice laminator. Haven't had any negative experiences with it yet and have used it periodically for two years now.,1
"These flags are useful for a variety of marking tasks, such as indicating important passages or places you want to copy. The flags apply easily and remove easily, just like regular Post-It Notes. I have left these flags on for a long period of time, perhaps as long as a year, and have seen no effect on the paper marked.There are two difficulties with these flags. First, there are only four colors and if you need to do something like a term paper or other similar research where you need more than four categories, you have to add a designator to your flags. I have made a cross reference and indicated A on blue = Topic #1, B on yellow = Topic #2, C on red indicates Topic #3, etc. The other difficulty is that there is little room to write on these flags, so they are more useful for indicating than writing. I have also used regular Post-It notes as flags when I need to make a note about a particular passage.These flags are also useful if you want to mark other things, such as unread books on the shelf, the location of various types of recipes, or to remind yourself that there is an item to be taken care of (such as flagging a tool that needs returned to the garage toolbox). You are limited only by your imagination.I have one set of these flags available because even though I use them only occasionally they are very handy to have when I do need them. 3M also makes a variety of other flags and though I would probably use them from time to time, I have found that these flags and regular Post-It notes handle most of my routine needs.",1
After trying several manufactures I came to the conclusion that Hammermill Laser Print is the best paper.,1
I bought this answering machine because it looks good but I am very disappointed with the clarity of the recorded messages it is the first digital answering machine and it might be the same with all others but I used to have till now the one that records on tape and it is not to compare,0
"I received these and downloaded the free Avery templates from the website. The download took ~40 seconds. In 3 minutes, I was able to select, modify (add a picture from my Pictures file folder) and print a sheet of custom return address labels that actually came out much better than I expected. It just doesn't get much easier than this!I have used Avery labels for years, but had stopped a few years ago. When this came up on Vine, I thought it was a good time to get reacquainted. It is still easy to use, and the templates provided are more than enough for 1"" x 2 5/8"" labels! The only glitch was a complaint from Word that the margins were outside of the print area. I just told it to print anyway, and the labels came out just fine. The photo was clear and easy to see, and the printer fed the label sheet just fine. However, be aware that if you print labels on an ink jet printer and it gets wet, it IS going to be a mess, so I would use these for return address only or put a piece of clear tape over the label to protect it from moisture.All in all it is very easy to use, easy to setup and easy to modify. I took off one star because the template made Word complain, and many computer users might worry about the error. Honestly though, it may have been my quick modification that caused the error. I would say this is a good product, and would recommend it to others.",1
"I am soooo happy with this cart. It does exactly what I need it to do. The handle folds easily. It fits great in the trunk of my car. It is very sturdy, able to handle fairly heavy loads, rolls well over different surfaces. It is light enough to lift easily. I looked at the critical review that talked about the bolts loosening so I made sure I tightened them well and I haven't had any problems. When it comes in the box, the bolts are loose and are meant to be tightened as you put on the wheels. I don't think the handle is too low and I am 5'6"" tall. A-One product. I appreciate this well-made item.",1
"I just purchased this binder to replace my 5 Star Flex Notebinder (which was a useless, poorly made product). So far I love this binder! I am using it to primarily take notes and it works great because of its hinged ring apparatus. The rings are not attached to one particular side of the binder which allows the rings to flip back and forth while note taking. Which means you can fold the front cover around and behind the back cover and have to binder lay flat on a desk while taking notes (something that you really can't do with most binders). This was completely worth every penny I paid for it.",1
"I bought this because I needed $3 to get super saver shipping and the reviews I read encouraged me to try these pens. I haven't written any long letters, but I'm an avid list-maker, brainstormer and doodle a lot. The pen writes smoothly. I don't have to stop and shake it or anything. Clicks fine. Has a decent ""soft"" feel. I would have liked the black to be a little blacker. If I can't find my favorite every day pens, I'll buy this one again. It's a good pen to have on hand in the house, and probably works well for schoolwork. If I was buying for an office, I'd suggest buying a small pack before buying bulk because it might be too light. Maybe the word I'm looking for is crisp. But it certainly doesn't clog and does write evenly. This is a smooth pen, but I don't feel the writing is crisp. But it is definitely a good household pen and a great value. I recommend it, and I'll probably buy them again.",1
"Has all the described features and holds my cards well. I thought the 240 slots were part of the plastic pages, but there were less there and then the last few are the side pocket ones. Decent binder but doesn't look as nice as in the pic. The brown leather one I bought was much nicer. Still great product and works good for holding your cards. The leather is sensitive to touch and gets marks in it easily, but the inside organization is great.",1
I purchased this product a month ago and it is workinng fine with good sound quality but only thing is i got it with only medium ear bud but not all three sizes.,0
"I was annoyed to discover that in tvm calculations the machine rounds up the number of periods and there is no way to prevent it. This is also stated in the manual. Lest someone is tempted to call this a feature, consider that the &quot;feature&quot; has been removed from more recent financial calculators (thus solving for 'n' on the 17BII correctly displays the fractional part whenever appropriate). Also, the construction is somewhat sloppy; on my sample the keys rattles when the calculator is shaken and the Enter key is labeled slightly off-center.Doubtless, the HP 12C makes a powerful fashion statement on everyone's desk, next to that typewriter and rotary phone. Those who value substance over style, however, should look elsewhere.",0
I guess you might say tape is tape is tape but there are varying qualities from the cheap generic to the more expensive name brands like Scotch. Right here around the Holiday Season gift wrapping is certainly something we're doing a lot of so a set of three rolls of tape comes in very handy. This particular tape sticks on flat and clear so as not to obscure your wrapping paper. A definitive advantage over the cheaper tape is that the adhesive is very strong - this tape is not going to pop off the paper as you work on a complex wrap job. Once it is in place it stays. I like that. It pulls from the roll and tears off well on the cutting teeth. Overall it is good quality tape.,1

"This printer/fax/copier worked just great for about a year-and-a-half. In fact my original review was very positive. But then the thing just died without warning ...6 months after the warranty expired coincidentally enough. The only help I got from tech support was an offer to sell me something else - which I bought because I was in a bind - the 6310 model and it has lasted longer but never printed a colored page properly a day in its life and at almost two years old has not aged well. There was a time when HP was the best of the best for products like this, but I think those days are over. How sad!",0

"I have been using this phone for more than two weeks now. The reception is clear, range is good. The menu and directory system was intuitive to me. I did not have any problems setting it up. I also liked the fact that batteries are standard AA rechargables. Excellent all-in-one.Since I do not have an additional handset I cannot comment on the comm. among handsets.If a speakerphone (something that I have never used) is not important to you, I definetely recommend this system.",1
"I purchased this tape to seal boxes that I would be storing in the attic. We have Brown Recluse spiders in the house and I didn't want them finding a home in the boxes being stored. I wanted a tape designed to handle the extreme temperatures found in an unconditioned attic space. Since this was advertised as ""designed with a long-lasting adhesive that works in hot or cold temperatures"", I ordered a 4-roll pack last fall and used it to seal several boxes. Unfortunately, the tape did not perform. After only a few months, the tape began pealing off all the boxes I applied it to.",0
"This is a very cool product made with just three pieces of stainless steel.It folds up into a very small space and holds a small to medium sized book in a near-vertical, open-face position with a certain panache.But if you're working from a very thick book, you need a different bookstand. The convenience disappears when you have to be finessing some of the pages of a large book onto the outside of the vertical 'placeholder' and the rest of them on the inside.I like the idea. 'Shame they don't make a large size, too.",1

"Both nephew and niece in high school have this calculator [one silver one plus] and 'luv' them.For all practical purposes the TI 83+ and Silver are THE 'regular persons' calculator. For 99 % of high school students, and college also if not a maths major, this series is more than enough calculator.If you not in high school or an English major in a city collage this is a boring machine. I suggest that you consider the Texas Instruments 86 or 89 or the Hewlett Packard 48G+, 48GX or even 9G if you need a graphics calc.[the T.I. 83 is the only game boy allowed in class].",1
I'm totally satisfied with the AS1018CD - it does what it says it will.It is a great improvement over my old cheaper Aurora shredder which alsodid what it said it would. This one is about 4 times as fast and a bitquieter as a bonus. I recommend it for home/home office use.,1
"They always buy us these cheapo calculators at work that either break or that you have to hit with a sledgehammer to get the keys to work. This one showed up on my desk a month ago and is TERRIFIC, which pleasantly surprised me.The cover is extremely useful and appreciated because I hate things that get gunky and dusty like computer keyboards that never never get cleaned. The cover keeps this one grime-free and scratch-free. The screen is a nice large size and can be adjusted which is very handy, the keys are big and the math functions are in the 'right' places (the other day I borrowed a calculator that drove me nuts after an hour because the x sign was to the right of the plus and I had to keep looking to find it).Great calculator for great price!",1
"One of the worse products I've ever bought, luckily I bought it locally and it's going back. Like another reviewer said, it either doesn't cut or it gets stuck inside after you do get it to cut, then you spend time opening it, taking out the stuck tape, weaving it back through, closing the case, taping, gets stuck, wash, rinse and repeat. Talk about taking forever to wrap a gift and the wasted tape when it doesn't cut.My husband thought I just didn't know what I was doing, so he tried it, same results. I came on here hoping that maybe there was some ""magic"" trick I wasn't getting, obviously there isn't one, this just plain doesn't work as intended. Don't waste your money on it.",0

So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though.

"Im a UK vonage customer & have just received this d-link VWR as an upgrade since i was having troubles with my old linksys router.This d-link fixed the problems I had with the linksys but introduced tonnes more!Major set-backs ive found so far:1)Awful web admin interface. Get anything wrong & no error messages are displayed and all the details entered disappear! Is only compatible with IE.2)Wireless A/P setup is temperamental. I've set up the WPA encryption, saved and everything's fine until a power cut, or its unplugged... all the settings in the router get cleared leaving the access point open to all with no security!! Very bad!3) The device doesn't allow wireless clients access to wired lan clients for some reason. Somehow they cant see each other in the workgroup or even ping each other using their assigned Ip's! So unless all your PC's are wireless or all hard-wired in there no chance of file sharing here!My advise... steer clear of this one! Get a decent router, and buy the simple vonage telephone adapter (d-link VTA) instead.",0
"5.8GHz phones are out of date. If you haven't tried the new DECT 6.0 phones, you're missing out.

"I got this to replace the my current mouse pad, which is (supposedly) exactly the same model. I bought my old one back in early 1999, it is well used, has seen better days, but still has plenty of life left in it. My old one has soft gel that conforms to your wrist and flexes when you move your wrist. This one does not. It is very hard gel and has a lower profile than the older one. Technically, it does provide wrist support, but so can a brick. The mousing surface actually is softer, but that it a moot point, and it is thinner, which gives a lip at the edge of the pad. Actually, the pad is softer than the gel, pathetic. BTW, the old one was made in USA, this one is made in China. Sad, sad, sad replacement and I will be returning it.Oh, and to the reviewer that compared it to uncooked steak: close, but less rare, more well done and left on the counter over the weekend.",0
"This is the best phone for the money, and I'd shopped around for awhile. My previuos phones were not good at all. The volumes was too low even when you adjusted it. This phone had no problem with the volume, it goes nice and high if you want. i also like the distintive rings that it has . You can program it so if a certain person calls, you can have a certain song or ring. The ONLY thing that is bad is that two people cant talk at the same time on both of these phones, so you would have to switch back and forth, but otherwise it has everything even back light, so when the phone rings at night you can see who is calling.",0

"Oh, let us count the ways:1) The battery life, as everyone mentions, is horrible. I suspect their recharging unit is not very smart, and thus they kill the batteries thanks to overcharging due to the so-called battery 'memory effort,' but I do not know this fer sure. The battery in one phone has now died on us, one is now so faint you can barely hear it, and the last one doesn't recharge much, and dies within the span of a 10 minute conversation when 'fully' charged.2) There is also a short in the system, possibly related to the bad battery life, that results in the LCD screen blanking out when the phone is on the charger, and it only sometimes comes back alive. This makes the nice Caller ID LCD feature often useless.3) They are NOT at all cheap for this level of crappiness. We decided to spring for what we thought were 'high-end' phones and got a terrible phone instead.We will probably try to find the Energizer ER-P511 batteries to see if that solves our problems. But I'm tempted to go back to old but far more reliable phones. Alas, if only our cell phones worked in the house. (DON'T get me started on that one...)",0
"we purchased this phone for its looks: cool, stylish, rugged. however, over time, its buttons have started to fail (like many of the other reviews). the first button to ""go"" was the ""phonebook"" function. yes, it was annoying to have to remember phone numbers for friends and family, but this was not the fatal flaw.now, the it is difficult to answer the phone and to end the conversation with the ""on"" and ""off"" buttons. this became very frustrating in many ways. imagine speaking to somebody on speaker-phone and end the conversation, but the person is still on the line!!!prior the the motorola, i had a panasonic cordless phone which lasted years. this is the first and last time i purchase a motorola.",0

"Okay, I've read the reviews and hope the rest of you thinking of purchasing this phone have as well. The basic advice, do not buy this phone or any other phone from Motorola. This phone as well as the MD41 have a keypad that WILL fail in about a year; just past the warranty period. I have called Motorola and they will not claim responsibility for this issue. Other posts have said that they have gotten remedy from Motorola; which is good for them, but now Motorola has stopped that practice. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OR ANY OTHER PHONE FROM MOTOROLA!!!",0
"I should have read these reviews more carefully before obtaining this product. For a cordless phone, I expect that the sound quality will be poorer than a corded phone, but not this bad.

It's either on or off.",0

Works with both Microsoft office and OpenOffice. I have not tried it on a Mac however.My class was doing presentations and everyone that I could talk into using this thing did very well with it, even with only a 5 second intro into how to use it. Two people in my class are looking to buy their own now.I hate public speaking and having something like this where I *know* it will work as it should makes it just a little bit easier.

"Overall, the 8885 is a good phone system. I agree with the minor flaws pointed out by Xrlg (below), but there is a &quot;workaround&quot; for #4. The phone does not display a prefix of 1 on the caller ID, which is a problem when you try to dial the number or store it in the directory. However, you don't have to edit the entire phone number to fix it. You can use the * key to automatically add/remove a 1, and the # key to automatically add/remove the area code from any phone number. You can then dial or store it that way. Not ideal, but it works.",0

"I thought I'd save some time and money buying a notebook online instead of heading to the campus bookstore. Bad idea. Without being able to see the product before purchase, I had no way of knowing how cheap it was.The pages are not perforated, but sometimes they rip out easily because the edge is cut too close to the spiral binding. The binding also works its way out of the pages because there is nothing at the ends to keep it in place. The notebook is also floppy, so it needs to be resting on a flat surface in order to turn the pages.Next time I need a notebook, I'm spending more money, and examining it in person first.",0
"I thought this phone had cool design with its small size and lack of antenna. What I found out is the designers sacrificed basic functionality for whiz-bang gadget appeal. The most important feature of a phone is sound quality, and the sound quality of this phone is very poor. It is very difficult to hear people talking even in a quiet room, and if you turn up the volume the mic just picks up more room noise and makes it worse. There also some basic functions that are made overly complex. To use redial for example you are forced to toggle through several menus on the LCD screen rather than just hitting a button. The phone is also too small to hold comfortably and it looks like a remote control and gets lost on the coffe table.",0
"Purchase phone on Amazon to replace Vtech 2.4 Ghz Model, we had for 3 years. Phone works like old one including PhoneBook bug that forces you to re-enter the whole phone number to add a ""1"" to front of long distance numbers captured by Caller ID. Main issues are the green night light that makes the display hard to read. Compared to the orange-amber light of the 2.4 Ghz model was a step backwards with it's bold face display. The satellite phone only worked for a year before getting a Warning!! Check Battery message on the display and the battery with no charge. The model I have uses a single battery pack and not the new rechargable AAA version. I followed the troubleshooting guide and even bought a new battery and still have the Warning message. Contacted Vtech and they said I need a new phone. I'll get a new phone but not from Vtech. This phone is bearly a year old and lightly used. I can use the phone but I need to pull the battery out and reinsert it (reboot) to temperarily fix the problem and charge the battery. To have two different battery pack versions means there was a redesign and I got Version 1.0. Otherwise, the phone works fine.",0
"I have delayed adding my review of the AT&amp;T 2462 system while giving AT&amp;T time to make good on their warranty. They have tried but an inferior product has caused them to fail.I initially bought the base system with 2 additional handsets to use in my small business. From a phone aspect this has been a very good system. Call sound quality, handset range and battery life, speaker phone on both base and handset, intercom/paging work fine.But the answering system is TERRIBLE.The sound quality of your recorded greeting is worse than most tape based devices. Sound qualtity of incoming messages (when they can be left) isn't much better.The biggest problem is the total unpredictability if the answering system will work at all. Most of the time when the answering system kicks in it will play the first 1-3 seconds of your greeting then disconnect the call. Or, it will allow someone to begin leaving a message then abruptly disconnect in mid-message. Trying to retrieve messages remotely can take 4 or 5 tries before you proceed far enough to enter your access code. Then you wonder how many incoming calls encountered this nonsense before your tried to access messages. Once back in the office the call log gives you an idea of how many others encountered the same problem.And, I have been through 4, count'em 4 base units that have all done the same thing.I have given up on the 2462 to take my messages and am using an old digital answering machine for messages.I am stuck with this unit. All AT&amp;T can do is send another swapout unit and I'm tired of spending time starting over. They won't buy it back and it's too late to return it.If your looking for a good 2-line remote handset phone, the 2462 does well, if you need to rely on it to collect and allow remote retrieval of messages look elsewhere.",0
"I thought these were a god-send at first because I was so sick of cuts from metal fasteners. Unfortunately, these are not much better. The adhesive holding the fastener to the front and back is weak, causing the fasteners to fall apart. Also the coating does not cover the tips, where I most frequently experience cuts on my fingers. Basically, this is a cheap piece of crap. The other folders have the fasteners woven into the actual folder so they don't fall off. They need to improve the coating on this product and make it so the fasteners don't come off. Sometimes folders show up without the fasteners at all because they're already fallen off before they are packed into the box.",0
I use this book monthly in a small home based business. It comes in handy to track all the expenses of running a daily business. To the back of the book there is enough space for keeping track of employees pay and taxes taken out. It is undated which is good for starting at any time of the year. Enough pages for all necessary entries in any business.,1
"I was looking for something like this for months. It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search. Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed. My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out. During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time. After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died. I haven't even begun to look for a new one. Very disappointed",0
This was delivered without the starter pack and without the carrier. Had no way to try it out. Returned to sender.,0
"Pros: RPN; allowed on the PE examCons: Pretty much everything elseI bought an HP 48S in the early 90's when I began college, and still use it every day at my job as an EE for an electric utility (RPN is so addictive that I even have to use it to balance my checkbook). However, the older HP's are not allowed on the PE exam, hence my purchase of the 35S. To coin a phrase, HP calculators ain't what they used to be.I was hoping for a least a few similarities between this model and my beloved 48S, but I have yet find many. Entry and manipulation of complex numbers is nowhere near the same and their display is somewhat confusing in polar mode. The stack behaves differently as far as the ENTER key is concerned. Even removing the unit from the packaging was a pain (literally). And don't even get me started on the lack of a printed manual.I could go on, but you get the idea. After the PE exam (if I pass), this calculator will become a $50 paperweight. Meanwhile, they'll take my 48S away when they pry it from my cold, dead fingers.",0
After almost 3 years of use I still love this phone. Even my husband can figure it out. I also have the base unit (KX-TG5240) and another handset KX-TGA520M) and they all work flawlessly.,1
I had my flat screen tv hung on a bracket from the wall. Lots of messy looking wires hanging from it. this organized the wires and keeps everything looking clean and orderly. It is a little difficult to install and the zipper gadget broke halfway through so I needed to do the rest by hand which kept pinching my fingers. End result looks very good. Would use again.,1
"Great medium weight paper for classwork. It's consistent in size and markings, and I'm not having to go through my entire binder with little adhesive reinforcements. Just basic college-ruled paper, but it fills its function well. Wouldn't mind it being a bit cheaper, but I'm willing to pay for durability when it comes to my note-taking in class.",1
"First off, let me say that this is by far the best solid mouse pad I've ever owned.Pros: Sleek look, adjustable lighting, solid build quality.Cons: Requires a USB port in order to use lights, not as portable as a foldable mouse pad.Style:This product looks drop dead gorgeous. Especially if the rest of your setup is using blue lighting. The entire pad is made of clear, very solid acrylic. The surface is layed over the acrylic and provides a very hard surface for your mouse to rest on.Surface Quality:I've owned lots of mouse pads; hard, soft, porous, reflective, matte, you name it. This surface has a good matte finish. It covers a very large area which ensures that your mouse never wanders off of the matte. I've used many gaming mice with this product and have always had great accuracy and response from all of them, including the Razer Mamba which another reviewer sad there was troubles with. I had none of those to speak of at all.Lighting:The lighting is fully adjustable and can be turned from extremely bright to completely off to suit different tastes. The Cybersnipa logo on the surface also lights up as well as the bullet and tracer line through the ""TRACER"" logo. It adds a very nice effect and I get a lot of comments on it from people who see my build.Material Quality:Top notch. The acrylic is very solid, and the mouse surface resists scratches very very well. As far as mouse pads go, I don't think it's possible to find one that's more durable, especially for the price.",1
"We bought this controller last December for a series of presentations around the world. This puppy has worked perfectly fine, flawlessly for all of our presentations. It has the basiec buttons, operation is super straighforward and is top quality (it has survived the hands of my co-worker, who is a complete animal). Highly recommended!!",1

"Excellent tape. It's strong, it's sticky, and it's clear - a winning combination. It sticks to cardboard boxes really well, and doesn't peel off like some inferior tapes do. Also, it fit into my tape dispenser easily (but that's probably b/c of some universal size for these sorts of things). I will use this same brand / type of tape again, especially the next time I move and need to make sure my packing boxes stay closed. Also, I find the tape to be almost imperceptively thicker than usual, and solid enough that it doesn't snap/break if you try and break it.I recommend this product.",1
"I was in the market for an economical two handset cordless phone without an answer machine and this came highly recommended. However, sound quality is terrible and the volume is low. When you speak into the phone, there is a loud echo into the earpeice that makes conversation quite difficult. It is definitely not a phone that you want to have more than a very brief conversation with. My prior phones have been Panasonic and I think that I will go back to that brand; this phone will be banished to the garage for occassional use only...",0

"I've had this phone/clock for about a year. While I like the compact design, the actual performance left something to be desired. The clock sometimes &quot;gets stuck&quot; after the alarm goes off and then the clock time is off by several minutes. I had to double check the time every night before I went to bed to make sure the time was correct. The display is too bright for a night stand, even on the low light setting. The caller id indicator flashes if you don't review the new calls. It is very annoying to have a light flashing when you are tryijng to go to sleep. I had to put tape over it... Last but not least, the alarm sound was not pleasant to wake up to. I bought a new cd/clock radio that I am very happy with and I am going to get simple phone with no flahing lights. I would not recommend this product if you like to sleep in a dark room.",0

There is an almost constant hissing static (especially when I'm talking - it's like when it's transmitting out).

I attempted to configure the device through a browser, but cannot get my network to see the device at the IP address listed in the docs. Spent all kinds of time on the phone with tier 2 tech support folks. They advise that although the device is configurable through a browser, that it is plug and play, and that being able to connect via the browser interface is unnecessary. I have noticed no change or improvement of any kind in my VoIP speed or quality. I cannot recommend it and I have no way of knowing if it even works or not.",0
In Michigan this costs $69.99 at Wally's World and $69.99 at Meijer. It's $59.99 at our local hardware store. $89.99 is $20-30 more than you can get it for today at a B&M store.,1
"I had been looking for a magnetic note pad center for quite some time and I just couldn't find one that I really liked. Then I came across the Forma Memo Center and I really liked what I saw. It appeared to be a quality memo center and the stainless steel would match very well with our kitchen and refrigerator. So I immediately purchased both the Memo center and the separate pencil cup. I have to admit that I was really quite surprised when I received them as these really are very high quality pieces. They have a great weight to them and the magnetic backing is more than capable of holding it in place. They also look very nice, much better than I expected them to look. While it looks nice in the picture, it definitely looks much better in person. We have a stainless steel refrigerator so the memo center and pencil cup just blend right in. If your looking for a stainless steel magnetic memo center then you should definitely give this one a look.5 stars!",1

"I purchased two of these machines at the same time, they work good in the beginning but give it a little time and you will find them to brake easy. Where the back part folds down to snap in they have little plastic tabs. My first one, broke on the right side and my second one just broke on the other side. What happpens is your recieving faxes will not come through because it needs to seat correctly. Plus the film is expensive. I've called panasonic and basically to get fixed you might as well buy another one or just toss it. I took a hammer to my first one..Litteraly and I'm ready to do it again with the second one. They are cheaply built. I vow to never again own a panasonic fax machine! I spent 200 bucks a piece for these. Simple Junk.",0
The graph paper fits the product description. I have no complaints with it except that I wish that it had smaller squares.,1
"I purchased the phone based upon the reviews I had read here at Amazon but had a negative experience myself. There is often a false call waiting signal whereby the people on the other end of the line hear a clicking and I miss a few words of the conversation. This happens as often as once a minute. I called customer service and the phone just rang and I finally hung up. I tried a few days later, got thru, and they told me to try reprogramming the phone and to check the line itself. I tried both and the phone company repairman said he had encountered similar problems as well as echoing with this phone with other customers. I tried calling customer service again on the main number given and no answer but last time I had gotten another number to call and tried that..and got thru. I had to send the phone back to them at my expense (even though I've only had it for a month...Office Max only allows returns for two weeks unless you buy an extended warranty policy, which I did not do) and it can take as long as six weeks. They said they did not recognize the problem. I am afraid I will get it back and the same thing will happen again. I am not happy.",0

Don't throw you $ away...brioke within months and we rarely use this phone in the house...broke in 2 different places!,0
"This little machine works well and is well laid out. It's easy to use, whether via computer or by hand. But it's heavier than I imagined (2.5 lbs). And it has this annoying quirk: when using it with the computer, it cuts an extra blank label of about 1/2"" before printing the label. Technical Support said all Brother labelers do that. (See their full response below). When printing by hand, there's extra space on your label before and after the printing, which you can cut off manually. When printing by computer, there's an actual extra blank label that the machine spits out and cuts before printing your label. In either case, plan to waste about an inch of the tape for every label, no matter what size label you need.That said, it really is great to be able to print labels on the fly. I'm envisioning a much more orderly environment very soon.I noticed some reviewers either here or elsewhere complaining that the labels are hard to peel from their backing. This is not true of the labels that came with my labeler. The backing is split and very easy to peel off.Here's the explanation from Brother Tech Support about the extra length of label:PT2600 PS 5100 There is approximately one inch of space between the printhead and the cutter blade within the P-touch label printer. The three layers of material that make up all P-touch laminated labels must pass over this space in order to be sealed correctly and to feed correctly. Ordinarily a small piece of tape, 1 inch long, will first precede the printed label to ensure that this happens. This extra feed material cannot be eliminated. However, the piece of extra tape can be added to the printed label instead of being cut off by changing the ""Margin"" setting to one inch. There is no way to eliminate the excess tape feed.",0
"This is an altogether nifty product. It's durable, not too cumbersome (I can tuck it under my arm while working), and the perfect size for the invoices I use in my job. Add a sturdy paper clip to the form-holding bar at the left and you can carry receipts and customers' payments alongside your day's blank work slips. In all, it's an indispensable piece of equipment for me.",1
Purchased this phone because neighbor and I both have same 5.8GHz phone which causes interference and unexpected hang ups. Use of 2.4GHz phone eliminated problem. Good value for lower frequency phone which has same range and clarity as higher frequency models. Unit very easy to set up using manufacturers simple to follow instructions.,1
"I bought several packages of these because I am a teacher and use a lot of white out tape. I have always used another brand, but these were less expensive and I figured they would be equal quality as the other brand considering they were made by a well-known company (Bic). I have been VERY disappointed with them. The tape never stays tight and I am always having to waste white out tape to ""wind"" the loose tape. Also, the tape turns easily so that the plastic side it facing out instead of the white-out side. I took one apart the other day to try to fix the turned tape and that was a disaster! I ended up just throwing the whole thing out because I was so frustrated trying to get it back together right. I had a student yesterday that had one exactly like mine and he was pulling it apart and trying to fix it too. I guess I'm not the only one with problems with them!",0
"I researched quite a few cordless phones before I purchased this one. It is the best cordless phone I have ever owned. I have had Uniden and ATT&T and this is superior. The intercom, speakerphone and transfer to other handsets is great. The sound is really like talking face-to-face, and the battery life is just as promised. I don't think you will be disappointed in this choice for a cordless expandable phone system. I have used the Panasonic headset with this phone and it works great, too.",1

The Table came in good time. This table is very versatile. We are very happy with the service and the Table.,1
"I feel compelled to write this review, despite the fact that I bought this chair (in black leather) three years ago, because it stands out as one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I am 5'11"", of medium build, and this chair is profoundly uncomfortable to sit in. The sensation is that your body is being *rejected* by the chair--pushed out of it toward the front, as if it does not want you sitting in it. Researching chairs, I was taken in by all the Freedom Chair hype--for example, how wonderful the perfectly even armrests are, which are supposed to keep your body aligned. The reality is that the armrests are attached (cheaply) with a large 'U' of metal, with only the crudest ability to adjust them. They ""clunk-clunk-clunk"" into 4 positions, only one of which is actually practical to use. And think about it: Any good tailor will tell you that most people's bodies are NOT perfectly symmetrical, with one arm or leg or shoulder being half an inch higher or longer than the other. Making a chair's armrest mechanism cheaply, with no ability to adjust the arms independently--and then claiming that is a superior feature to other chairs, to promote balance and harmony? That's not just cheap, it's not just pretentious, it's hogwash.I could go on about other failings of this chair (shoddy construction, leather that puckles and wrinkles after light use of two years, arm rest panels that are separating from the frame, etc.), but I think you get the idea. Bottom line: I wince when I think of the money I wasted on this purchase. Do better than I did, don't believe the hogwash, and avoid this pretentious, poorly-designed, and obscenely overpriced chair.",0
"The quality of this DayTimer binder is excellent. The leather is glove soft, the stitching is excelelnt and neat and the color is perfect. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quality product that will provide years of value.

I would have given no stars, but the rating system does not allow for it.",0
This is a piece if junk. I have never written a review in my life but its so bad that I was forced to write this. I bought this for my son in 2nd grade and he can never find what he is looking for. I am going to buy another one for him now. Don't waste your money on this junk.,0

"Let me be perfectly clear: The product is 5-star. The price is below 1. I have been looking for these printer packs for nearly a year when I noticed the huge disparity in what I had been paying (around $30 for F120P) and what has become something akin to the way we are abused at the gas pumps.Sony 4 x 6-Inch Print Pack with Snap-Off Edges for DPP-F Printers (SVM-F120P)[[ASIN:B002KDCZXA Sony (SVM-F120P/2) Photo Printer Paper 120 sheets]Searches have come up with zip, zero, zilch regarding what has happened, except for one rather oblique link stating that Sony was selling their dye sublimation unit to an outfit called DNP. However, there doesn't seem to be a way to find out whether this new organization will or has already made print packs compatible with the TWO Sony digital printers that I have. What a rip off this all has evolved to.Further, I cannot understand or appreciate amazon.com continuing to advertise these overly-inflated and apparently ""old stock"" items from Sony. The print packs have clearly identified expiration dates which would lead me to believe that IF one had the inclination to pay perhaps 2 or 3 times what was once the normal charge, you'd wind up with something not only no longer manufactured, but out of date as well. A rip off.What I have learned from all of this is Sony is a low class organization packaged in world leader garb. I've been burned by them with sub-par customer service regarding cameras, printers and televisions. Now this!As for amazon.com, shame on you. I've been a customer of yours pretty much since the get-go and there is little doubt that anyone on your staff follows these comments - rants by any other name! Your pages are full of comments from well meaning individuals that reside in the Ether, but apparently never passed on to anyone who can rectify a bad situation. A rip off.",0
"Only for the desperate.I was preparing for a quickly approaching open book test and needed some correction tape to correct some errors in a text book. Went to the store and bought the only available brand (Wite Out) and figured it was the same quality as the stuff I have used at work, which was Liquid Paper and another brand that I can't remember. I was wrong. The tape is WEAK and will tear about 80% of the time if you have to overlap a previously applied strip. The fact that you can write with pen over a single strip without the tape shredding is a miracle. If you have a choice, pay the extra buck to buy the better stuff. If you can only find Wite-Out, I would suggest leaving and trying another store. I swear, I almost look forward to making mistakes so I can get through this stuff faster.Also, do not fool yourself into buying combo packs of these things - there's no amount of money saving that will justify the selection.",0
"Looking at the picture led me to believe that the handheld receiver was thick enough in the back that I could hold it without my fingers getting in my way when I talk, but as soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell that I would have a problem with it.If it were cheaper, I might not even bother sending it back, but I paid 40 bucks.

I have returned the phone once within the store warrantee and I have replaced the batteries twice in 2 years, which are hard to find and costly. Panasonic customer service has been neither helpful nor sympathetic to my problem. I am now researching a variety of less 'recommended' cordless phones...",0
"This phoneset has a fantastic set of features far beyond the minimum critera that I set. It was hard enough to find a phoneset that would meet my criteria. But, the 2402 just blew me away.I bought an extra handset. I named one &quot;Office&quot; and the other, &quot;Kitchen&quot;. The names appear on the high-resolution LCD display (not that basic 2-line or 3-line block display) at all times while the phone is idle. Features for each phone can be programmed independently from either phone through the &quot;wireless network&quot;. The headsets are incredibly lightweight. They are almost weightless.Having the base, which requires no physical interaction, hidden away, or at least away from desk clutter, is a big plus. The biggest advantage of this is that each headset needs no phone jack, just an AC outlet for its charger. BTW, some have said that the battery life is low. But I find that not to be a problem at all because the most logical place for the phone when not in use would be the charging cradle. In fact, you could have the headset programmed to auto-answer upon removal from the cradle then conversely automatically hang up.Another misnomer that I have seen posted in a review here is the 2402's compatibility with DSL. I have ADSL on Line 1 and the 2402 has no problem. Actually, I can't imagine why any phone would.Another misnomer posted in a review here relates to being able to retrieve a call on hold from a different headset. That is part of the &quot;privacy&quot; feature that can be enabled or disabled.Conferencing is easy and crystal clear. Redialing from the Caller-ID call log is a great feature in which you can pre-program into memory local area-codes (good for multiple area code, 10-digit dialing cities such as Atlanta) so that it would know how to dial a 10-digit number (local or LD). And so on and so on...Bottom line is that this phoneset is just fantastic. I am quite pleased with it. If there is one feature that I wished it had, that would be speakerphone capability.Overall, I'd rate it a Strong Buy with 5 stars.",1
"The ""fabric"" might as well be paper gauze, it's so thin and flimsy. Out of the box, the ""fabric"" was torn and coming loose around every attachment screw on the back. The ""fabric"" on the seat is attached with a ragged line of staples that can be seen by your guests before they sit down to have their clothes ripped by the jagged edges. I guess we should have reminded ourselves that ""you get what you pay for,"" though in the case of the Boss ""Fabric"" Plus(!)

"I appreciate a good cordless phone, but I am not willing to pay any price to get one. This phone was priced well, looks great and, best of all, performs excellently. I've been using it for several months now and my only complaint was recently eliminated by switching phone carriers. (Caller ID captures phone numbers with the ""1"" as a prefix, so you have to re-enter the entire number if you want to re-dial or store one of those numbers.) I find that my new Voice over Internet Protocol phone carrier (Vonage) works perfectly with this phone. It is compatible with what I consider to be leading-edge technology. Two things I particularly like are battery life and the built-in speaker phone on the handset. Range is good too here in the middle of NYC. Overall, I recommend this phone very highly.",1
"This is the perfect calculator for everything I ever needed, from Algebra I to Honors Calculus.The design is light and nice, the keyboard is great to use and it has all fuctions and even more, such as the convertor.

"First - like most office depot furniture items, this thing is cheaply made. The ""back"" of the hutch is a piece of floppy laminated cardboard instead of wood. The tops and edges are unfinished showing off the ugly MDF inside. Our unit came with several scratches on it already. However, we didn't expect too much from office depot so would have been fine, except that this hutch is made to go on top of the lateral file - and only this lateral file. If you bought the lateral file before you bought the hutch, then you have to disassemble the lateral file to install the hutch. The hutch is then supposed to be screwed onto the top of the file, but there are no screw holes nor markings on the file showing you where to connect the two pieces. We ended up damaging the unit more b/c there were no pre-drilled screw holes in place, and since we don't have power tools at home, it made it near impossible to screw through the top of the laterla file.",0
"I bought the magnetic strip as a means to keep my garbage drawer closed. It is a long story, but a simple drawer return would not work. My thought was to tap a steel washer (has to be steel - not stainless steel or aluminum) to one side of the drawer and then use the magentic strip on the other. Unfortunately, the strip is not magnetic enough to work.I will say that the adhesive used for the backing works well. However, the magnet barely exerted enough force to keep the steel washer from falling off.Final Verdict - May work well for very minor tasks (hanging prints on your fridge - although it will not hold a frame), but if you need anything more than that you may find yourseld disappointed.2 Stars",0
"These boxes do the job, but they differ from other generic brands that I have bought in the past. The main problem is that, height - wise, they are shorter, so if you make your own title dividers, they will not fit in the box because the height of the box is practically flush with the height of a comic book. This also means that your comics may get slightly crushed if you stack your long boxes on top of each other.

"To start, when this phone system works properly, it is very nice. The sound quality is fine, ergonomics are good, and there are plenty of features. To set up the phone properly and utilize all of the features it takes someone not intimidated by technology.Unfortunately after 12 months ownership, both of the handsets failed. The keypads stopped working so you could not dial out or hang up. Out of warranty I replaced them with two new handsets. 6 months later the base failed. When I called Siemens customer support to ask for help, they claimed a failure rate of &#60; 1%. Of course, being out of warranty, they wouldn't consider replacing the base. On my original purchase the Siemens product failure rate is now 100%.",0

"The dictionary works fine, but suffers from a lack of words, especially going from Japanese to English. To give one of many, many examples, it doesn't have Chuugoku (the word for &quot;China&quot;) going from Japanese to English. It's totally unsuitable for a student studying Japanese. It might be OK for a tourist or someone living in Japan who doesn't intend to learn the language, except for one other problem: the price.I had hoped that this dictionary would have a stock of words similar to the Franklin dictionaries that I've used in the past for French and Spanish, but no go. This thing doesn't have anywhere near the range of those dictionaries.",0
"Terrible. Horrible . Where do I start? The bad sound quality, the slowness of the dialing (you have to dial the number first then press go, like a cellphone. Otherwise you have to wait 1.5 seconds for the dialtone. If you dont, redial).Other problems - phone looses base for no reason. Some messages are very quiet, almost impossible to hear. Resets day of the week for no reason. Lots of messages where the person has hung up, and you hear the recorded message saying ""if you would like to make a call.. This phone looks good but really s BAD.",0

"I use fine or ultra fine permanent markers every day. I like how the fine point Marks A Lot pens write. They tip does seem to lose its shape a bit as they age, so the written line gets a bit wider. At first, I thought they might be my Sharpie replacements. That is not to be. I just went though a box of 12 in 2-3 months. Some only wrote for a few days. The same size box of Sharpies would last 2-3 times as long. Another thing that annoyed me was that I had to scribble on scrap paper to get them to write at full strength if I'd stopped writing for a few minutes. I wasted time, ink, and paper doodling so they would write correctly.",0

"This phone is the best I have ever owned. Clear as a bell from as far as about 70 yards from my apartment, outside, through the buildings brick wall. The person complaining about it not working with DSL is misinformed, in fact it CAN'T interfere with DSL. Of course if the person didn't install the filters that come with every DSL kit ever produced, then ANY phone will cause trouble. On top of that, because this phone is a 5.8GHz phone, it doesn't interfere with 802.11b (Apple AirPort, or any other WiFi) networking either. I have yet to hear ANY static of any kind using this phone.The caller ID works flawlessly. The hand set has held a charge for over 3 days without recharging. The memory works as advertised. There is even a jack for a headset as well, this jack uses a 2.5 MM input, which is becoming the standard for Cell phones, so there are plenty of choices of which head set to get. The speaker phones on both the hand set and base are very clear, and people I have talked to on them say there is very little distortion.This phone is easy to set up, has great features, wont interfere with the wireless or wired networking/internet connections in your house, and the price is right. I cant recommend it more clearly.",0

"I don't know about you, but the monster in my house that picked off socks for years has added pens to his appetite, and he does it voraciously and without prejudice. In my mind, it resembles the thing from Stephen King's &#34;It&#34; with the dude from the Waltons and Jack Tripper from Three's Company, except mine has socks and pens stuck in its grill. So I bought a box of these to strategically place around the house to use and sacrifice to this unholy pen-consuming beast from the depths of Hades' underworld. They are easier to replace than my Pilot G2's. They also make good back-scratchers in a pinch, but if you do that in front of your wife you'll feel you're better off dueling that thing from &#34;It.&#34;",0

There are some things that could have been made better on this phone...although, i do love many of the features. Its not very stylish either, but some of there newer models look pretty nice.

"I received the Harmonie as a gift a few years ago. Within about 2 months, the cap would no longer fit on the back of the pen because there is a button there that had gone askew. Having no place to put the cap was a huge annoyance, and also there is nothing to keep the pen from rolling when you set it down if the cap is not on.I contacted Waterman, but they said I would have to pay shipping both ways, and then they would determine if the fault was theirs or mine and charge accordingly. I didn't like that deal, and was shocked at their lack of customer service commitment, so instead took it to the store where it was purchased. The store sent it to Waterman for me, and it came back repaired more than 8 weeks later.Within two weeks the same issue occurred. I finally got annoyed enough to use some epoxy to glue the button back in place (not easy, as it doesn't want to be aligned with the pen, and needs to be for the cap to go on), and fixed it myself. Now, about a year later the button has come off in the cap and is irretrievable. The pen is ruined.I loved the way the pen felt and wrote, but sadly don't see how the Harmonie can be recommended in light of this design flaw. I'd also recommend looking at brands other than Waterman due to their lack of customer service, though I do not know the service reputations of other brands near this price range.",0

I was so disillusioned at this point that I did not even return it.",0

Background hiss, feedback (hear yourself talking), and dropouts.Also, all the phone's features are accessed through soft menus. This very modal behavior is difficult for many users. If my wife wants to turn off the ringer on the handset, well, she just puts it under a pillow!

"I'm writing this because I havn't been able to find any reviews at allon the Brother PT-1300. This Industrial grade hand-held labeler comes witha durable small black plastic case, great for packing out to any job site.PT-1300 is an industrial labeler listed as discontinued on the Brother site.First introduced in 2000, the PT-1300 was first announced at SCANTECH '99.This was the first industrial handheld label printer introduced by Brother.Also discontinued is the optional AD-60 AC Adapter, Output: DC 9V, 1.6A,However the AD-60 adapter is replaced by common Brother AD-24, & AD-24ES.-or just hunt around for compatible HQRP, same as AD-24 AD-24ES adapters.You can find the HQRP Brother-compatible AC Adapter for about $13. shipped.The PT-1300 also gets very good battery life on (6) AA alkaline batteries.Uses all common TZ style tapes, good variety of colors, from 1/4"" to 3/4"" maximum.(1/4"")=6mm, (3/8"")=9mm, (1/2"")=12mm, (3/4"")=18mm - Look for TZ tape in lots.-Also uses the inexpensive Sophia TZ compatible tapes. (These are excellent).Package of (5) 26.5ft x 1/2"" TZ compatible Sophia tapes to your door for under $40.Use the TZ ""S"" (TZS) Strong adhesive tapes for heavy duty applications.All TZ tapes are ""crack and peel"", split the back down the middle to remove backing..Features I like on the PT-1300:-Compact tough black plastic case.

"FIrst, the Tape-writer arrives in a nice heavy duty plastic carrying, protective case. I was worried about where I was going to store this, but since it has it's own case it fits easily on my tool shelf. Inside of the case is the Tape-writer, an instruction manual that appears to be clear and to the point. There is also two character wheels. One is for normal letters and numbers, the second is for reverse image. Finally there is a roll of Aluminum ribbon, and a roll of stainless steel ribbon. I was impressed with this package as I was only expecting the get the tape-writer and nothing else.The tape-writer itself is very solid feeling, made of 95% metal and a very grippy rubber handle on the cutting arm.This is my first metal tape-writer, having used the cheap plastic Dymo versions for years. I was hesitant at the price, but now having it in my hands I believe it was worth the money. Seems like it is built for the long haul.",1

"Allow me to say, for the price, this phone is ""as billed"". The system for inputting speed dial entries is clumsy, and often kicked me back to the main screen before I was finished entering data. I eventually got it set up, and the speed dials work as designed. The phone has two lines, but automatically defaults to ""line 1"" after each call, meaning making repeated calls from the same line requires pressing an extra button to return to line two. The headset jack works nicely, if you have your own 2.5mm headset - but after completing a call, the phone defaults back to the handset, requring you to depress the ""headset"" button again before dialing. The screen is large, lighted and easy to read. The ""message waiting"" indicator light works nicely with my AT&T voicemail service to let me know I have a voicemail. Lastly, the headset and handset volume can be adjusted during a call, but after hanging up, the phone defaults to the factory volume settings - again frustrating for multiple calls in a row. Speakerphone quality is wanting. Overall, if you're a business user, strongly consider paying the $100+ it takes for a quality desk phone.",0
"These are very nice aesthetically, durability appears to be good and the only feature shortage I attribute to the base unit, not the satellite handset like this (that feature shortage is a handset locator). I have bought numerous of these and am quite impressed.",1
"I order several boxes of these every few months. It's certainly true what other customers have said about them being thin. But I'd disagree with the ""flimsy"". Flimsy to me means shoddy construction, and these work just fine and will not tear or separate easily. If you're looking for something thick and sturdy, then this isn't the product for you, but if you just need something to hold a stack of papers separate, then these are a brilliant solution. I looked in several major office supply retail stores and couldn't find a clear poly folder solution that came anywhere near to this product in value. I think the negative reviews are unfair in that they are rooted in the fact that the customers were looking for something else entirely and basing their review off that. As a transparent file jacket (albeit a thin one), it fit the bill and does the job. I even bought the thicker version of this same product and rejected it as I preferred the thin jacket.",0
"These are good, standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings, wedding/shower invitations, etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer? Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands, but Avery has been making good labels for a long time, so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process!",1
Lovely deal on these tablets. Very handy I like to write a lot so this is convienent for me. I will be coming back to buy more,1

"Normally I am very pleased with Avery products, but these didn't meet my expectations. I had to feed these sheets into my high-volume laser printer individually; putting a stack of about 10 on the printer tray caused jams on two separate occasions.The labels stayed on a lot of fabrics and didn't curl too much but after a full day a lot of people had lost theirs. I had to press mine back onto my shirt several times during the day to prevent it from falling off. That said, these stayed on better than the OfficeMax labels I had tried previously. Might be time to invest in plastic badge hangers.",0
"This phone started off good, but the quality seemed to go downhill with continued use. After about a year, the handset hang-up button failed causing the phone to be ""off the hook"" every time you would hang up. The speakerphone part didn't work very well either. Pass on this phone.",0
"I purchased this to weigh boxes for shipment that are over 5 pounds, because I have access to a 5 pound electronic scale. I got really concerned when weighing a box, it got two different weights when trying twice. I had no idea which was right. I got 7.2 lbs, 6.5 lbs, and less. I assumed it was the highest, so I paid for over 7 lbs. At the post office, it weighed in at 6 lbs 10 oz.It seems to weigh different depending on how much forward or backward pressure is put on the platform.I highly recommend Ultraship 55 Lb Electronic Digital Shipping Postal Kitchen Scale, especially if Amazon stocks it again.",0

"I am so glad to find these pens on Amazon. I purchased two boxes. What makes them great - fine point, ball-point (not a fan of the roller balls and gel pens), ink dispenses smoothly and evenly when writing.

All around great pen and great price.",1
"I bought the 2415 base unit with an extension handset. From day one, the extension hasn't worked well at all. After about five minutes of talking my girlfriend claims that I start to sound like a dolphin, chirping underwater.This problem, by the way, happens everytime I use the the extension, which I now use to pick up calls initially and then go and get the other handest from the base. Kind of annoying. I tried Siemens suggestions to re-register the phones but it didn't work at all.I would look elsewhere before buying any siemens products.",0
"Great price for 4 phones with lots of features. Easy set up. Looks good, sleek and well made, with a small base.

"I realized I wanted to make a custom onesie for my son to wear at an engagement party. Sadly, I only came up with this idea 2 days before the party and it was too late to order one from a custom t-shirt website. I bought this hoping that the results would be acceptable. I made 4 onesies with 1 sheet of paper (cut it up in 4) and the results were very good. One of the designs I did ended up running a little in the wash. I'm not sure if this was because I didn't iron that one on long enough, or if it had to do with the design. 2 of the onesies came out really well though, looked like I had ordered them custom. Overall I was very pleased. And cost wise, this was much, much cheaper than ordering from a company and I was able to make the design exactly the way I wanted.One important tip, if your design includes words, remember to print it out mirror image!",1
"I tend to trust the buyers at Costco on products like this. Their judgments rarely fail, and they've certainly put good value for money into their warehouse store with the Uniden cordless phone. You can of course buy this phone at lots of other places too, but the Costo endorsement means something.We live in an 1930s era house with two stories + an office basement. The base station on the Uniden stays on the first floor, where heavy foot traffic makes it an easy visit to check on messages. One additional handset stays upstairs and the other in my basement office.Each handset fits nicely into a vertical position on its own stand. Reholstering the handset doesn't require fidgeting or that you hit the bullseye. Just drop it in roughly the right place and it settles into its stand. This makes a virtual 'no-look' hangup possible when I'm working at my desk. It's not a big day, but saves a few seconds per day and removes one slight irritation from life. I'll take that when I can get it.We've had excellent voice quality and no problems with this phone. The expandable feature means you can add handsets as you need them, but so far our two dogs and one cat have not demanded their own apparatus.If Costco's buyers choose it, you'll rarely go wrong. You can find a cheaper phone and answering system, but I've not seen better value.",1
"I have one of these ""antijam"" staplers. Have had it about a year. Somewhere along the way it just stopped functioning properly. Thought it was the staples so ordered some new ones.

"Both compartments (the locking stor-a-key & the normal stor-a-key case) are way too small for my 8 cm car key (2001 VW Passat). It will not even fit the smaller valet key (the one w/o the remote unlock button), which looks similar to the key depicted in the item picure. No amount of cramming it in will force the compartment to close; I estimate a 7.5 cm car key would fit. This will work with a house key, but then again, so would hiding your house key under a doormat (especially b/c it's made of plastic that can be broken). I chose this device because it has the magnet to attach to my car, and it is completely useless for that purpose b/c it is WAY too small for any modern car key. BOOOOOO!",0
"Only had my 8825 system a few weeks, so I don't know what might happen later. Right now though, this is a great system! Each handset is a speakerphone with volume control. Mine answers by picking up from the cradle without hanging up on anyone. That option must be turned on though. I can even get my messages from the handset. Also, the other reviewer is mistaken - I transfer calls from the handset all the time. You can transfer to any other handset or the base and you can even rename them for convenience. For example - I named one &quot;Basement&quot; so that is what shows in the display and on the transfer list. Older models (2400-series)had poor batteries that caused problems after 6 months - get rid of those NiCads! The new ones have better batteries. This system has way too many features for anyone to use them all. It's a room/baby monitor and supports headsets. You can turn on or off line 1 or 2 for each handset, choose incoming calls only, use different messages for answering the two lines, etc. Great in every way except the manuals aren't very well written. Good enough though - if you spend a few minutes with it.",1

I bought this at a local bible book store. I was so pleased to see that it saved phone numbers and personal info on top of being an electronic bible. The bible portion of this unit is awesome. I could not ask for anything else as far as ease of use and convenience goes.I started saving various numbers and bits of info. and then I shut off the device and put it in my pocket.Later on I pulled out the electronic bible from my pocket and turned it on only to discover that all of the data that I saved in the device was gone. I was baffled at first but eventually I realized the problem. This unit is so cheaply built and is so flimsy that the device bends/buckles. When that happens it causes the batteries (2 button style: CR2032) to lose contact with the unit's battery terminals hence causing the saved data to be lost.If this thing was constructed of better material that did not bend this would be a home run. But the cheap plastic case is nothing like the Franklin products from twenty or so years ago. The new style case is so cheap it has Made in China written all over it. Franklin needs to tighten up the design of the case. The use of higher quality materials that would stiffen up the case and make it less bendable would be a good route for them to go. Something that has heft and that is sturdy would be great. I do not think the price would go up much more if they used a better material. Just a thought Franklin.So the bible portion of this device is great. I have no complaints there. My complaints are with the cheapness of this device. It is so flimsy that it does not justify a price of more that $10.I admire Franklin for the things that they do and make for consumers but the cheapness here is an insult. I regret wasting hard earned money on this cheap thing.,0
These pens write very smoothly and look sparkly on all kinds of paper. I always get positive comments and/or questions about where to get pens like them. I've started giving them as gifts because everyone loves them.,1

"I needed to replace my presentation remote control and loved the Logitech model we had, but lost the receiver. Sadly, the model was no longer being manufactured by Logitech, but I was able to purchase a used one, and hope it shipped in time for my November 1 meeting. It arrived on 10/30, thanks to their customer service who, to my surprise, upgraded the shipping for no additional cost to me! I can't tell you how relieved and happy I was to receive it in time! The product, too, was in very good condition and working order. I tested it right away and was reasurred that it was exactly what I expected and hoped for. I love the simplicity of this remote model. There are lots of alternatives on the market, but they are either too large, too small, too many other features. We now have two, since I purchased the replacement, we found the lost receiver (the day the replacement arrived), but I'll keep the second remote because it's a good product and it's good to have that back-up. Great product. And great customer service by the seller. I love purchasing through Amazon!",1

None of the buttons worked properly and when I called the manufacturer the French Canadian customer service girl hung up on me before stating; ""If you bought the phone from some unknown company like Amazon, you deserve to keep it, I never heard of Amazon Too bad for you if it doesn't work."" Nice customer service ""manager"" she told me she was the manager when I tried to call back to complain about her. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND PASS THE WORD.

"This little shredder is the best! I've owned it for nearly 3 years now and it has NEVER jammed. I use it mainly for shredding junk mail and it works fine for my yearly file cabinet purge. Like the other reviewer said, it's not for heavy office use because it can't shred too many pieces of paper at a time and has just a 4.5"" slot (just fold your papers in half lengthwise). But for home use, this is the best shredder I have ever used. When (and if) the one I have quits, I'm going to buy another one.UPDATE: Still going strong in November 2008!",1
"This product is fantastic. A friend bought one and I liked it so much I bought my own. I tested it at an elementary school and the range is excellent. It was still turning pages outside of the classroom in the hall, and yes...through the cinder block wall! No joke, I was shocked. You didn't need to point it in the direction of the computer either. Finally a product that exceeds expectations. The buttons are big enough, and I have big hands too. Unless you want a bigger pointer that's bulky to carry around, this is a sleek size. No brainer.",1
"With a few drawbacks, this is a well-designed 4-line telephone. On the plus side, the base and remote handsets work well. In particular, the remote handset buttons are much more sturdy than they were in earlier Panasonic design. Corded-handset and speakerphone quality are excellent. The major drawback is that the ring volume is the same for all 4 lines. Previous Panasonic designs had individual-line volume settings, but not this phone. This is important to me because only one of the 4 lines is for incoming calls, the others are for outgoing calls, and telemarketers call all lines indiscriminately. My solution was to turn off the overall ring volume and use in parallel a separate cheap phone on the one line I use for incoming calls. I do not use the answering system because I have voice mail, so I cannot comment on that feature.",0

"i BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DESK AT WORK WHICH IS SPACE CONSERVATIVE. THE HEIGHT IS GREAT AND I LOVE THAT I CAN MOVE MY KEYBOARD OUT OF THE WAY COMPLETELY WHEN I NEED DESK SPACE TO DO OTHER THINGS.

"I bought this phone because it was cheap and because it got good customer reviews. I should not have put so much faith in the reviews. This phone has a shorter range than the 900mhz phone it was purchased to replace. The telezapper doesn't seem to do anything but make the phone beep when you answer a call. And, last but not least, the battery life on this phone is only about 15 minutes of talking on a fully charged battery. I am going to buy a new battery to see if that will fix that problem, but even if it does, I wish I would have followed the &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; saying.",0

Whoever wrote the specs for this phone was obviously copying text from some other fancier phone since most of the features mentioned are NOT included with this phone.

Cosmetically its ok so feel free to use it as a prop.,0

"This is my favorite pen by far. I was looking for a pen to use while journaling that wouldn't bleed through after awhile and these are archival safe --no need to worry about that anymore! They write very smoothly and it seems like they last a long time, I don't feel like I'm reaching for a new pen all that often.I love that they come in a wide variety of colours, though I wish I could find the colours in this extra fine point --the next step down, the 07 fine point, seems to always have a glob of ink when you first put them to the page, these do not, however.Good quality and a bargin for the price compared to what I pay for them at the local Wal-Mart. I'll be buying my pens from Amazon from now on!",1
I bought this set plus a base with answering machine. What a waste!!! I have returned it. Normally I use it only 15 feet from the base but would loose reception. Lots of noises and my voice sounded hollow. Like I was in a cave. People were constantly complaining about the phone when I was using it. Finally I packed it up and sent it back. I've gone back to my old Panasonic. My father bought the same phone and also returned his for the same reasons. A total waste of money. Buy something else.,0
"The caller ID stopped working after a few months, and we have to beat the phone repeatedly when we answer the phone, just to get rid of the static. I cant even figure out how to change the channels on this thing. if someone knows how, let me know, otherwise stay away from this model!",0

"The TRU8866 looks great on paper. Here are the critical flaws...Flaw #1) 5.8Ghz - Bigger is not better when it comes to the frequency band. The range of these phones is poor in comparison to 2.4GHz units I've used. Can't walk outside to the mailbox without the connection becoming extremely choppy.Flaw #2) As mentioned by others, incoming calls on the 2nd line cause an audible beep which cuts off audio on line #1. This isn't very good, especially if (for example) you use line 1 for work and line 2 for home.Flaw #3) There is considerable crosstalk if both lines are being used. That's real bad. I tested it with some friends, the good news is that the outgoing audio doesn't get much crosstalk (so, people your calling on line 1 can't hear what is being said on line 2), BUT, YOU can hear audio on both lines. It's faint, but very annoying.Flaw #4) After about 1 year, plan on tons of noise as the radio's in the handsets start going out of tune. The higher the frequency band, the more susceptible radio circuits are to the effects of aging. I called Uniden about 14 months after purchase because one of my units has a very bad background hum, they would not repair. The 2nd unit developed the same hum after 16 months.Into the garbage they go.I will say that the features of these phones is great, the mechanical quality is good, battery life is good. But, the flaws outweigh that. I think I'm sticking with Panasonic in the future.",0
"I should have read the reviews before buying. This device is not a shredder in any sense. It does not shred! It makes some pits on the data side to make it harder to read, but leaves the actual data layer fully intact! How can you call this device a shredder?!? A complete rip off, and offers virtually no security.",0
"Waterman makes great pens, even if you don't spend a small fortune on them they tend to be among the best you can get.

More people would take the time to write letters!",1
The cover and size of these books are just about right. They could be a little larger. However the cheap paper and the perforated pages make this product less than desirable. I will not buy these again.,0
"I am a design engineer and have had the HumanScale Freedom chair for two years. The chair has had two broken arm rests in that time, one still broken - one elbow resting lower than the other as i type this review. When a humans get out of a chair they use the arm rests to stead and support them selves on exiting. The field of ergonomics is the study of this type of action. It is natural. Something that should be considered in good design. I am not a big guy , I weighing 175 lbs. I broke both of these arms getting up from the chair while putting little pressure on the chairs arm rest.This company is in the chair design business. These weak arms rests are a design flaw. What company in the business would not have internal design standards for loading on arm rests, and seats and casters, etc? What company would not test for these loads during the design? What company would not fix the problem? Apparently HumanScale. The design of the arm rest is flawed and clearly designed to break, intentional design or just incompetence. It appears that this chair has been in production for many years judging by the reviews. HumanScale has known about this problem for all of those years. And guess what, in all those years the design flaw had never been corrected. A broken arm is replaced with another arm of the same design and it is designed to fail just like the one it replaced.Sure HumanScale will replace the arms for free, but i have to spend 2 or 3 hours running the chair back and forth, and I have the pleasure of typing this review with one arm lower than the other. This is not a good chair and not a good company. A good company would correct their designs.",0

"I have a panasonic cordless set I've been using for quite some time which works great, so when I decided to get another panasonic set for another room, I decided on this on. I'm not sure what happened here, either I bought a defective phone or Panasonic has really lowered the bar on quality performance. When dialing a number, usually right after dialing, it'll ring right away, however, this set, it makes several sounds, as if it's connecting to something, like an internet (?) and it takes about 3-5 seconds to ""connect"", then it starts the actual ringing. The volume on this set [need help] as well. There are only 3 levels, super low, low and ok. Don't they know some people have hearing problems?! And the ring to this set is annoying. It sounds retarded, not like other phone sets. And the ring volume, there's only two levels, super low or rediculously high. However, the major complaint I have with this set is you can't dial any number over 10 digits. For example, you dial the credit card company and then they ask you to punch in your credit card number, you punch it in and well, the phone thinks that you're dialing an actual phone number, so it'll make that ""connecting"" noise and it'll just keep on doing that, getting you nowhere so eventually, you're forced to hang up and maybe try again and get nowhere again. Luckily, I have another phone for cases like that. Overall, the price you pay on this phone is not even worth it. Even if it was free I wouldn't take it. Stay away from this phone. If I could give it a zero rating, I would.",0
"Last month, after about 3 months of ownership, the Vtech phones broke down. It seems that it would not hang up the line after a call, which caused my line to go dead after making or receiving a call. I would have to unplug the phone jack and plug it in again to get a dial tone, which of course lasted for one call in or out. I called customer service and after a long time on the phone getting though, and finally having to convince the tech that none of buttons were stuck, did they agree to replace the phones. I had to return the phones, at my expense, with all its parts and about 2-3 weeks later I received a pair of refurbished phones, not new ones. The phones came with parts missing such as wall mounts and belt clips, etc but at least they worked. After another two calls and two separate shipments from Hong Kong I finally got all the parts back but it really didn't seem worth all the time I had to invest.The battery pack gets very warm, even after charging for days. So, judging from what others have been saying about battery failure, I don't hold out much hope for them in the long run. If anything happens again I'll just dump them and go back to Panasonic, which I still have after 5 years of trouble free service, and had to put back in service while waiting for the replacement Vtech phones. The best I can say is that Vtech half heartily honored their guarantee but they really put me through the mill getting the refurbished replacement. I do not recommend this phone.***************************Update as of 08/25/2006**************I have been using my refurbished phones for maybe a month and now the batteries are failing after very little use. I am not going through the ordeal of contacting Vtech customer service (a misnomer) again. If I could I would change my rating to 1 star.",0

"I use this all the time. It's a piece of cake to use. I've never had any issues with the quality of the print. It does take a few trial and error runs to see which prints you like (I use the clear protective discs that come with the stack of blanks to test if I'm not sure). My only real complaint is the ink cartridges must be ordered. If these were available in stores, it would be much more convienent. So minus one star for that.",1
"I mean, not like someone doesn't make a dispenser for this stuff. If 3M wanted to, they could probably make anything having to do with adhesion. Probably already have.This double-sided tape is the standard by which others should be judged. Or not, I cannot recall ever seeing a competitor to this product, if I did I would not even bother checking it out. How can you improve perfection? What Scotch 33 is to electrical tape, this mounting tape is to.. everything else. If you have two smooth- or even slightly irregular surfaces needing to be stuck together, here it is. The uses are innumerable. I use it to affix magnets to notepads for refrigerator use. I use it to make model furniture mock-ups while in the design process. I use it to stick co-workers keyboards and mice to their desks when they are away.Awhile back 3M introduced these little gel-like squares that were also double-sided adhesive, and while they would definitely do some things the foam tape would not, they fell far short in sheer versatility.i must admit I prefer the 3/4"" or 1"" width, but this is the size generally found in most any type of store.

"The pen is everything it claims to be. But many of the reviews miss what I believe are the greatest selling points.Visual: It is stunningly cool to look at. The elegant curvy shape and smooth stainless steel finish - just a great, sophisticated looking thing - like a space alien dropped it and you were lucky enough to discover how things will be made by an advanced civilization.Tactile. The bullet shape feels good in you hands and fingers. If you ever fidgeted with car keys or coins in your pocket, they will need to step aside. It seems to emit positive energy into your fingers.Carry-ability: This is my favorite asset of the space pen. If you like having a pen on you, but don't want to carry the long thing we generally think of in a writing instrument, this is perfection. It is so short when folded, it will naturally ride deep in your pockets, or even in the little coin pocket you find in jeans, and you won't even know you have it with you. And the smooth shape means it won't mar other objects or your clothes. The way it seals, there is zero chance it will leak ink onto your clothes.I've had two for roughly 20 years, and besides a scratch or two, they're like new. They've taken a number of rides through the washer and dryer, have both been lost, then found numerous times to my delight.Bullet-style space pens are bomb-proof, waterproof, beautiful, can write wet or upside-down, have a fascinating historical legacy, will be the coolest pen at your meeting, and will pretty much last your lifetime if you can keep from losing them. And for well under $20 are the best writing tool investment you will ever make. Buy one!",1
I would never buy another fax machine from Panasonic.You can't get this one to move the paper when it is in fax mode. It holds very little paper and the film runs out very quickly.

"Installation was a breeze. Sound quality is good. There are two important features lacking on this speakerphone. In the product description, I overlooked the fact there is NO mute button on this device. If I had realized this up front, I would not have ordered this speakerphone. The other lacking feature which I was aware of, is that there is NO external volume control. Mute and volume controls are both accessible thru Windows, but I find that method to be quite annoying after a while.",0

"I like this hanger. It works reasonably well. The only gripe I have is that the design does not truly allow you to position the monitor at any height. It does not slide along a track. Instead, you choose which holes to use when setting it up and then it stays there. There are holes at several different levels -- so there is some choice, but it is limited. If you're looking for something that can slide up and down on the fly, this is not it. Of course, you could take it apart and use different holes -- but that definitely isn't a quick adjustment.",0

"Reeves, in my opinion, is not user friendly. There are so many wonderful paint-by-number companies that make it so much easier to follow, use better paint, better canisters, and a MUCH easier canvas in terms of lay out.Reeves shocks me! The only diagram is on the back of the box vs. a separate sheet. The paints are difficult to open without making a mess. But what really makes me crazy with them is that they don't supply any details so you have to rely on the picture on the box AND the way they set up the mixed colors is frustrating.Fortunately or unfortunately, their pictures are usually fabulous (if you can improvise on details on your own). Since they insist on using double numbers for mixed colors (i.e. 22/40) and they don't always fit in the space, they use an arrow-like line. That means that you can't go ahead and paint that space because then the space where it is pointing to has obliterated numbers unless you look at the back of the box top. And if you paint the 'arrowed' space, then you paint the arrow-like line and you see sets of numbers in the next space (that previously pointed there) and it gets so confusing.In other sets, particularly PaintWorks, the paints are easy to open/close, they are joined together so it's not all individual pots, the mixed colors are labeled with a letter and a LEGEND is supplied! They supply all of the details except in VERY few instances. And, if you call customer service, they actually know how to help you with those details with great suggestions.I try to avoid Reeves but once in a while someone requests one of them for a gift and I suffer through because the end result really is great.",0
I liked the combo phone/alarm/cd but found the product to be the worst quality of any home electronics I have ever purchased. Both the original and the replacement lost keypad functionality within a month of use making it impossible to dial out.

"I purchased these poly mailers from the seller FantasyBuy. The mailers arrived overnight (since I paid for overnight) and packaging was fine, no problem. When I first looked at the mailers I realized they were different, but I thought they looked pretty cool. The insides were black instead of the gray color they usually are. The outside of the mailers were gray, but had a different 'feel' to them. The big problem came when trying to stuff them. They are lightly sealed shut from top to bottom, and you have to work something into them to get them to open up so you can slide something in. This created a huge problem when trying to stuff things quickly since I process dozens of orders a day. If you go too fast they tear quite easily. I really HATE these mailers, but since I only ordered 100 and needed them asap, I kept them and endured the agony.The other mailers I have purchased on this listing (from other sellers) just open right up without sticking.

WHOOPS! I don't know what went wrong at the factory but something did, the knifes feel &#34;used&#34; and slightly dull. They rip my paper, I get messy feathered edges, they just don't work.I'll probably continue buying X-Acto, but never again buying these from amazon and not in the 100 pack.

"Anyone who says they like it, doesn't use it.What does work? Yes, the speaker phone works both on the base and handset. You can acutally dial out, that works too.OK, the hold button works too.What doesn't work: everything else. I've had this for about two years now. And I _try_ to use the features. I read the manual. BUT:The screens are too hard to read.The menu system was done by someone who knows nothing about human-machine interfaces. It's very awkward to use.The autodialer (directory) is painfully slow. I just timed it. To scroll through the list and pick the third entry takes 7 seconds, and I cheated since I pressed keys before I could see that I should. That may not seem like a lot in print, but how long should it take? I think it should be more like 2 seconds.Some of the phone programming requires you to use the base station and handset at the same time. For example, if you want to change the numbers of rings before the answering machine picks up. Why would anyone software developer worth his pay develop a system where sometimes you do it all on the handset, sometimes you need both the handset and base? Laziness, pure and simple.The round toggle button on both the base and hand set frequently do not register presses. The one on the handset is just to small for a multifunction switch.Even the labels of some buttons are bad. On the handset, one is called 'direct'. What does that mean? Another is labeled 'function/ch'. You tell me.The connection from handset to base sometimes drops out, usually just as I answer the phone. And I'm only 40 feet from the base!The answering machine function is buggy. The telemarketers that call and hang up on the machine cause the answering machine to indicate a message is waiting. If you listen to the message, you hear about 5-10 seconds of silence, then a 1/2 second of some previously recorded (and erased) message.Another reviewer wrote that the handset is small enough for a woman but big enough for a man. Well my hands aren't that big but I have to hold it by me fingertips.You can't please everybody, especially with something like handset size. I can live with that. If Panasonic hired some decent engineers (especially software), they could probably make this phone decent. But as it stands now, don't buy this phone.",0

It is a grayish blue that is fine, but not what I consider to be orchid (i.e., a light lavender); yes, I know that a grayish blue is part of the orchid spectrum, but the color is dull. The paper, however, is very good quality, and if you are not fussy about color, you won't be disappointed.",0
"I purchased this same phone except in a &quot;see thru&quot; grey model and have found the phone to be excellent. It is solid, the storage and caller ID features work very well, and I can go all the way around my large yard without cut-out or interference. Although it is a bit bulky for shoulder use, the included headset works well and i don't use the shoulder move anyway,(bad for the neck.) The best thing about the phone is that it is solid, I have 3 little ones and I feel this phone can take the abuse of falling on the floor.",1
"My old man bought me the HP 12C for my first finance class in college in 1990. I used it through college, for my first job, and now my own business. It even survived the girlfriend's dog (the case did not make it though).After you use the 12c and get use to the RPN, using anything else seems antiquated.Quite possibly the finest mechanical/electronic item I have ever owned!",1
Second phone never worked. Quality of speakerphone was abysmal. We gave up on it and bought a different phone. Save the money,0

"My project is making booklets using 10 to 25 sheets of 24 lb paper, and I sometimes need to add or remove sheets. I have used other binding methods which work okay (covers with prongs) but I was looking for an easier way. I had several assorted binding bars from some insurance policies that I tried and they all worked great, so I ordered these C-Line bars because they are supposed to slide on easily and have a 40 sheet capacity. The first thing I noticed about these bars is that the ""jaws"" are firmly shut tight against each other, whereas the the ones I had found around the house were slightly open. I made up some booklets this weekend of just 12 sheets. I found there was no way to force the sheets into the bars without first prying the bars open with a tool. The sheets by themselves were not stiff enough to open the bars. Unfortunately using a tool required 2 hands, one to hold the bar and one to hold the tool, so my wife had to hold the booklet while I got the bar started a few inches up the edge of the sheets. From there I could slide the bar the rest of the way in the normal fashion. Some of the booklets had plastic covers and some plain paper, but it was equally difficult either way.These bars just do not work as advertised. Of course I want them tight enough to hold the booklets together, but not so tight that it takes 2 people to get the sheets into them. I don't know if it is a poor design or if they are defective. The first time I used a tool -- a small piece of plastic -- to open the jaws, the plastic of the C-line bar cracked. That is how tight and rigid they are, but I was able to use 10 more of them without cracking. I would have sent them back but didn't feel like it was worth the trouble.",0
"You will NOT be happy with this! This is incredibly buggy on both the hardware and software side. Royal will NOT respond to your inquiries for help with this product (they say they will, but trust me on this one). The picture you see isn't even the DV2, it's the DV4. If you must buy a Royal PDA, get the DV4, but you will be frustrated and disappointed if you get this one. Run, don't walk, from this item!",0
DO not buy this pad if you have a wood finish surface. I purchased the Microban mouse pad six weeks ago. To my horror when I removed the pad there was a clear outline of the pad in my new $7000 desk Apparently the black non stick-surface of this pad can react with certain wood finishes. I can't recommend this pad unless your desktop is a non wood surface.,0
"No fax machine is flawless, but I really like this machine. We've had one at the office for... a couple years now (?) and it never has problems. I bought one for my home office about a month ago and I'm very happy with it.The only annoyance I have is along the same lines as comments others have made... that it goes into sleep mode after you feed the pages through. However, when it sends it tells you that it is sending if you are watching the display. So I don't have a real issue with the display. And although the display is small it is also backlit (!) - which is great for me because the machine is in a dark corner of the office.I read the reviews here on Amazon before buying and they helped to sway me towards this unit. I can say that I'm very happy with my choice so far.",1
"I was very excited about getting a labelmaker, and after some research, settled on the LetraTag. It seemed fairly priced and was just what I needed.I made a couple of labels and was pleased - the dozens of symbols and various fonts that the LetraTag offers are fun. Unfortunately, after only a few uses, the labels came out faded. I switched the label cartridge, but the next label came out almost completely blank. I cleaned the inside with the little brush, changed the batteries, and tried a power adapter - all of the suggestions on the Dymo website. None of these worked. I e-mailed Dymo's customer support; they were relatively nice and sent me a new one. I had to send a couple more e-mails, however, to find out if they wanted the broken one back (they didn't).I was excited to get my new labelmaker, but this time the first label came out faded. Then the second. And the third had barely a fleck of ink. Now I have two brand-new labelmakers that won't make labels.Either I have a crazy electrical force field like Sean Patrick Flanery in Powder or this product stinks. I'm betting on the latter, and would not recommend this labelmaker to anyone.",0
I was shopping for a phone system that could meet and grow with my needs. I have had a phone system that worked for 14 years. It finaly failed and was no longer being produced. I was looking for a system that had many of the features that my Nextel system has but for my home. I ended up with the system from Panasonic. It has been very easy to set up and use. I would recomend this system for anyone who is need of three or more phones. I bought the set of three and have added 2 more phones to the system. I like that they have a speaker that is loud and clear. Also the set up on the computer web site is so easy. If you are looking into a new phone system please look at this phone.,1
Noisy reception. Horrible UI. Stop charging the handset after 1 year.,0
"As with other reviews, I too am happy with the quality of this product. I've ordered other KidKraft toys with great success; it's reassuring to know they consistently produce top-notch items. The color shown is a true representation of what you'll get. It looks fantastic with our decor. It's the perfect edition to round out my 2 year old granddaughter's kitchen play area. Now she can cook and serve her meals for all to enjoy. I know she'll get plenty of use from it over the years to come.",1

"I once had the expensive Siemens cordless system, but ditched those on Ebay b/c of the horrible ergonomics. If you picked up a phone call for another person, you couldn't just yell, 'pick up the phone' b/c the other units couldn't barge into an existing call. You'd have to remember the cumbersome process of call-forwarding.Anyhow, the VTech system doesn't have such problems, so right off the bat I was encouraged. Out of all the great features this system offers, you cannot custom name each station. You are stuck w/ the default numbering. Thus if you want to transfer to, or page, another handset, you have to recall which phone is which number. What is more surpising is that older VTech system allowed custom-naming, according to tech support.Contrary to a previous review, I didn't find the answering machine quality horribly poor, but it isn't stellar either. I can certainly live with it.What I think isn't so hot is the general sound quality when on the phone. I would have thought that 5.8GHz would be the best I've ever had. On the other hand, phone lines only transmit a very poor quality sound; something like the equivalent to 11kHz mono (vs 44kHz stereo for compact disc music).My only other complaint is the general crappy belt clips that snap onto cordless phones, including these. If you bend over &amp; the phone is too far towards the front of your belt, the clip snaps off &amp; the phone tumbles. Better design would be appreciated.",0
My son made good use of it for the semester until the screen cracked. He had it in his backpack. Even the separate compartment did not help it survive against the heavy textbooks. He asked for another one but I am hesitating because of the cost for such a short life.,0
"I am in the process of moving and have been looking at paper shredders in order to dispose of some accumulated documents. I couldn't find a shredder that had steller reviews so decided to put off buying one. I was able to borrow this shredder from a friend. It worked great for what I needed.It is loud, but not unbearably so. It doesn't seem louder than many other household appliances.It shredded years worth of documents, without and problems. I didn't load up 10 sheets at once, opting for some smaller number, especially since many of the document's were printed on heavy paper. I didn't have any overheating or overloading issues.The compartment does fill up quickly, but I think I like the size of the machine. I was able to keep it near my desk whereas a larger container would have been awkward.Additionally, the CD and credit card optinos make this a great machine for home use.",1
"I got two of these boxes to hold LiFePO4 batteries and controllers for my e bikes. They are actually pretty easy to work with. I drilled holes to mount the boxes and to mound components inside the boxes.I read other reviews saying the locks on Buddy Boxes were weak. The locks are not super strong, but about what you would expect for a lightweight lock box, and they do work very well. These are the same kind of locks you would purchase in any hardware store. I had to bend the tabs on the locks to make them fit snug, but otherwise after a few hundred miles they are working very well.Overall the Buddy Boxes are great! They do the job and were offered up at a fair price. Delivery was on time and the finish on the boxes is good, they look real nice on the bikes.If you want to see them on the bikes, just check:[...]Happy biking, and EVsRock!",1
This shipping tape consists of excellent quality. It is very easy to package up items with its attached dispenser.

"I ordered this board because I thought it was a great deal and it had received nearly all five star reviews. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the packaging and immediately noticed that the board was warped. I thought maybe it would straighten out when it was sitting on the screws in the wall, so I proceeding to follow the directions and I put the board up. It did not straighten out. I then contacted Amazon and they agreed to send me a new one because the first one had a manufacturer defect. The second board arrived today and again I was disappointed, it was also warped. It was a little less than the first one, but still it would not lay flat on the wall. I would not recommend this board to anyone, it is poorly made and it will leave you disappointed. I ended up purchasing a board elsewhere, at a more expensive price, but of much better quality.",0

These phones are hard to come by nowadays. It is perfect and exactly what I was looking for! I did not want a slimline because the wires and cords are all inclusive on those phones.

This pencil is perhaps the worst i have ever used. the lead breaks so easily that i constantly have to pump out more and there is no tension on the lead so you have to hold the pencil flat for it to come out or else the whole piece falls out. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting a quality mechanical pencil or just using an old fashioned one,0
"We bought one of these new but after a couple of months the stapler jamed; I took it apart and found the 'anvil' that moves over the staple when it strikes gets warped, not made strong enough to withstand the pressure put on it by the stapler.

"This stapler appeared to be quite heavy and solid - that's why I bought it! Well, it was great for the first week. Then I accidentally knocked it off the table onto the floor, which is carpeted. The ""metal"" on the base broke into two pieces right across the middle, making this $20 stapler virtually useless (the entire front ""half"" broke off in front of the supportive sides)! The ""metal"" base is NOT metal - it's some type of composite metal as opposed to the good old-fashioned steel that was used in the past for making heavy duty office supplies. I wouldn't pay even $5.00 for this stapler! Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in Swingline . . . especially since this is the second Swingline stapler I've had to break the first time it fell from less than three feet - the other one was a Swingline 747 which broke when one of my students picked it up from my desk at school and accidentally dropped it on the floor. Swingline products are just not as good as they used to be. I'm done purchasing them . . . unless I can find one of those old, dependable black metal ones at a flea market or garage sale!",0

"I'm with Kevin ... it is just over a year that I have had this phone and the handset has faded into uselessness over the last month - guess when the warranty ran out - planned obsolescence or circumstance?? I really liked the ""chain dialing"" feature since I make alot of calls with a calling card and the phone was generally clear, although I often got the comment from the people at the other end of the line that I sounded distant or was hard to hear. The handsfree and memory dialing were very good and I used a headset off of the handset regularly. I thought the phone was reliable ... until the meltdown. I thought I was getting a long-term product, not a one-year disposable.",0
"I bought a Siemens 2420 desk station and 2 handsets. Everything worked great in the beginning. Within a year the desk station stopped working altogether. I took it back to Office Depot where I purchased it because I had purchased a warranty. They replaced it.Soon afterwards the cordless units would not hold a charge, nordid they hold a charge after I purchased the exact duplicate batteries.Then the desk station would shut down on the second ring of an incoming call. All the buttons would light up red and the LCD display would be all blocked out on the second ring. It would then reset itself and repeat the process on the next incoming call.Siemens technical support HAS NO authorized or unauthorized service/repair centers. They suggested I take the phone to my local electronics repair shop.......or buy a new one. Yeah right.I would definetely NOT purchase another Siemens product.",0

"Absolutely top-notch tape -- nice and thick, adheres well, and is easy to tear by hand (I'd tried a tear-by-hand tape about 5 years ago when I first noticed the product, but that tape was a lot harder to tear -- I think they have improved it a great deal.) Sometimes it doesn't tear on the first try, but I'd say about 80%-90% of the time it does. Mind you, it's not going to be as easy (obviously) as masking tape it to tear, but it's easier than most duct tapes.One disappointing thing? The roll really is a LOT thinner than the picture seems to show. Note that 50 yards is not much -- this is less than normal (non tear-by-hand) tape that is usually given on a roll. I was shocked when I got it that it looks to have about 1/3 to 1/2 less tape on the roll than the picture shows. So not a good value if you're going to need to use a LOT of packing tape, but very convenient if you only need a bit of packing tape now and then.",1

"I am majoring in Spanish in college. I needed something to help me with my homework. This is a good dictionary, but the verb conjugation is designed very badly. You have to hit a function key and an arrow key to move between tenses-then there is a little &quot;page turning&quot; symbol for 4 seconds.That means if I want to get to the subjective tense, it will take 40 seconds of watching that stupid little symbol turning &quot;pages&quot; and pressing buttons over and over. If I wanted to turn pages, I'd use the book. The long and the short is, I can conjugate verbs quicker with my 501 verbs book than this thing. When you enter a conjugated verb in, it does not translate it for you, it goes to the dictionary and gives you the infinitive. If you want to replace your dictionary, this will do ok, and buying the flash card makes it almost a PDA, but the card did not work right either.

"I am trying to glue a handle back on a porcelain sugar bowl, and I bought this at Michaels. The package instructs you to ""slowly squeeze adhesive onto surface"" - well, this glue is as thin as milk, so there's no ""slowly"" about it - it gushes out of the tube. Then the instructions say to apply the glue and hold porous pieces together for 15-40 seconds, then allow 16 hours before putting into dishwasher. I held the two pieces together for 15 minutes and they were still as wet as could be, and not set up at all, so I couldn't leave the bowl to set for 16 hours as instructed. I can't clamp or tape the handle while the glue sets, it's just not going to work that way. Waste of money for sure.I ended up getting Loctite Ultra gel Super glue, which is a nice gel, a very accurate applicator tip, set up right away, and after letting the sugar bowl sit for a day, the handle is firmly stuck on.

"Had some rugs in the house that would slip when I stepped on the corners and wanted to apply carpet tape with double sided adhesive to the bottom of the rug to prevent the slipping. I discovered the tape I had ordered/received had adhesive only on one side and called the manufacturer's customer care center (Intertape), but was given no assistance to return or replace the item. Later, when I got Amazon's e-mail request to rate/review my transaction, I rediscovered that the description of the tape (Intertape #9970) I had ordered was, in fact, double sided adhesive, and further that it was shipped by Amazon and not a marketplace vendor. After explaining the problem to Amazon's Customer Care, I was given a return authorization with understanding that I would be refunded upon their receipt of the tape. My lesson is: deal with Amazon customer care, not the manufacturer's customer care.Rating for the product: not applicable. Rating for the manufacturer's customer care for assistance: 1 Star. Rating for Amazon's customer care for assistance in correcting the problem: 5 Stars.",0

"I wish I had been able to read the other reviews for this product prior to purchase because believe me, they're true. Unfortunately I bought it late one Sunday evening after my home phone broke suddenly. It was a total disappointment and I ended up replacing it after two miserable months. I can't imagine how it rates it's 5.8 Ghz since everything seems to cause interference. The phonebook allows you to appoint ringer selections to each entry, yet there is no correlation between what is in the phonebook and what comes up on the Caller ID. And the range... well, let's just say it might as well have a cord. Actually, it would be better with one, that way you wouldn't find yourself losing a call because you ""wandered"" 12 feet away from the base! I purchased mine for about $85 and still feel completely ripped off. I can honestly say that I NEVER had a satisfactory call on this unit. Steer clear of this one!",0

"The display contrast makes it hard to read and there isn't a way to change it. There are 20 ringer sounds to choose from, only 2 of which are bearable. The ringer is hard to hear even on its loudest setting. After a few days the phones stopped displaying the caller's name and number and only displayed ""no data"" or ""incomplete data"" (I know its not my service because my upstairs phones were displaying it fine). The sound on the answering machine is terrible, my outgoing message sounds like I am talking into a can while standing in a cave.The only good thing I can say about it is the range. I was able to walk all over my house, upstairs and down, even go outside, and I never lost the connection or heard static. My other phones break up when you leave the room their base is in.But in the end, the phones are garbage and I strongly recommend staying away from them.I have returned the phones since they are clearly not worth the price.",0

It has musical ringers, changeable banners, each handset shows if the line is being used in another room, a light blinks if there is a voicemail message and you can push the END button to silence the ringers of all the phones if you aren't going to answer the phone at that time. It also has an intercom option and a monitor option. We really like it. I can't think of anything that I don't like about the phone except that there doesn't seem to be a button to push if you can't find the handset.",1
These wall files are very sturdy. The plastic is thick and there is a large magnetic strip on the back. The only negative is they are a bit shallow. A lot of bins are deeper to hold items securely both vertically and horizontally.,0
"As you'll see by clicking on most Aurora shredders and reading the reviews, they use cheap plastic gears to run the blades, and they invariably strip (even if you follow the instructions - I never came close to running more than 5 sheets at once, much less 7), rendering the machine equal to a wastebasket with a very heavy lid.I hate junking something that looks so new. I'll never again buy a shredder from these people. If you do, I hope you know how to fabricate your own gears...because you definitely can't get new ones from the company. Even if you are able to track down a Customer Service number (hope you read the Da Vinci Code, that will be good practice), they don't answer their phones. High class operation all around.",0
"I intended to purchase these items for two teachers of my daughter as a Christmas gift. After opening the box, I embarrassed to give it to them. I asked myself this is an authentic ""Cross"" pen. It is definitely not on the same quality as they used to be. Cross has moved manufacturing to China and Chinese made version is ....!!! My eldest sister used to give me one set of Cross pen and pencil after my graduation for the past 20 years. Until now, they are still nice in the box and my memory.",0
"I thought this phone was a great deal at $49.95 from Circuit City, that is, till I got my first call. The voice on the other end sounded so tinny and soft. I immediately clicked the volume button to increase the volume, but found that by doing so introduced some sort of feedback thru the speaker. My own voice was being affected by this interference. I never said anything to my wife, but she said the same thing to me after using it for a day and taking calls from other people. I took it back to Circuit City and ended up buying an AT&T E2725B set from Wal-Mart for $67. There is a world of difference in the quality of the sound. The Uniden set sounded like a really cheap phone in comparison.",0
"As far as I can tell, this is the same phone as the V-Tech 2431. I owned (for a short time) both phones and did not see a difference either functionally or cosmetically. I found the ATT to function similarly to the V-Tech -- very poorly.The functionality of this phone is fantastic, with interesting features that I'd never even thought of, like the speaker on the handset. However, it has incredibly poor reception. On a conversation with the base and handset in the same room (less than 15 feet apart), I suddenly experienced terrible static. I had the same experience with a separate handset that I purchased. I also had the same experience with the V-Tech phone (at a different location within my home). I did not have this problem with 2.4GHz phones that I sampled from Uniden and IBM.Though the features are amazing, this phone simply didn't work for me.",0
"I had tons of coins built up in my office. I had experience with the battery op type and wasn't satisfied. I came across this manual crank sorter, so I gave it a shot. It takes big piles of coins and sorts them with 98% accuracy. There are some overshoots and mistaken slots occasionally, but overall, a very good machine. If there's a jam, you can reverse a bit, unclog the jam, and continue. I recommend this sorter for a stockpile of coins of home requiring some organization.",1
BROTHER DK-1207 CD/DVD LABEL ARE BEING USED IN MY P-TOUCH LABEL MAKER I USED 3 ROLLS AND THEY ALL CAM OUT JUST GREAT VERY HAPPY,1
We have two computers and two printers in our household and seem to go through a lot of paper. This paper is of good quality and works perfectly with inkjet printers.The paper is very white and sufficiently opaque to permit two-sided copying without bleed through. I also appreciate the storage feature which permits the box to be placed in a closet for storage and yet provides quick and convenient access to any amount of paper.I will buy this product again.,1
"This was perfect -- just as described. The price wasn't horrible, either. Works very well, and very sturdy.",1
"This is actually a great laminator for 8.5&quot; width items - it's really easy to use. It is ready to go as soon as you turn on the power. The built-in cutter is very useful and convenient. It is also easy to change cartridges.I do wish I spent a more money so that I could laminate slightly wider items. I've had to trim some of my items down to the 8.5&quot; width. If it were wider, I would have given this product 5 stars.",1
"I have had many cordless phones and this is by far the worst cordless phone I have ever purchased. The phone works one day and not the next. I get ""OUT OR RANGE"" messages with the handheld just a few feet from the receiver. Numerous other unexplanable problems. There is a number to call for customer service, the problem is that so many calls are coming in you can't get through. It appears that Uniden is another victim of ""MADE IN CHINA."" I can't return the phone to Amazon since returns must be made within ten days. The good news is that I didn't throw away the old system that it was supposed to replace. From now on I'm sticking with Panasonic.",0
I would not hesitate to recommend and get this bubble wrap again. I use it in my business for wrapping small items before shipping and it works well.,1
"I just received this in the mail today as a gift for my husband for christmas. I tried it out and it works great! Although, it better for $35! It looks very professional and high quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",1
I really loved this phone until the keypad started failing after one year of use. It was very disapointing. Based on the other reviews I will definately be contacting Motorola.,0
"These easy peel labels are so very nice and easy to get off the backing that I went out to look for more. Some brands are close and hard to separate, but I found these a pleasure to work with. I will definitely be buying these now.",1
"At first I thought I'd like this phone, but in practical day to day use it quickly became a disappointment. Specifically, there are issues with the phone reliably connecting to Skype and doing even simple things like playing voicemail messages (it now plays them for us but we can't hear anything, from either of two handsets). In addition, it has been disconnecting and reconnecting from Skype continuously which is highly disruptive.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention. When you're on a call, and another call comes in, it beeps in your ear and EVEN WHEN YOU REJECT THE OTHER CALL, IT STILL BEEPS ENDLESSLY, FORCING YOU TO ABANDON YOUR CURRENT CALL TO MAKE THE BEEPING STOP. Totally annoying, and makes the phone useless.A very poor, immature, 1.0 product. Save your money and look elsewhere.",0
"Hi, I have been a packet8 customer for almost 2 years now. I love the service from Packet8, ... and I have tried the other providers as well. I have had voice for a while and love it, and decided to purchase the video phone since Grandma/Grandpa want to see there new grandkids. We love it! I also used Packet8 coupon code ""gateshare"" from http://www.gateshare.com to save $20. The site has a lot of useful information. I will never go back to the Plain old telephone system.",1
"I bought this niden 2-line wireless phone system with 4 phones, and only three work at a time, the 4th won't register no matter what I do. After a few months, I'm having trouble on all handsets with the volume suddenly dropping by 50% so that I can't hear who's on the other line and have to switch handsets mid conversation.I am now shopping for another manufacturer as this phone is too unreliable for my business.",0
"The positive: I wanted an &quot;industrial strength&quot; printer/copier/fax for my home which has a PC network and some heavy users. As a STANDALONE, or attached to ONE PC, this is every bit the product advertised.HOWEVER, the Canon IC D680 is not compatible with the print servers that come built into home networking hardware. You have to buy another $170 proprietary print server from Axis. I did, and regret it. The Canon/Axis combo is HIGHLY UNSTABLE on my network, especially when interfacing with Windows XP PCs. It usually works for a few documents and then fails. Failure requires a server reset, and often a complete DRIVER REINSTALL on the offending PC (2 CDs and 2 reboots!). It's a nightmare, and Canon tech support (which isn't available nights or weekends) has no idea what's wrong. I've been back and forth with them half a dozen times, including several multi-hour calls, and 2 months into ownership can't get it working.Don't go here, it's miserable.",0
Nice assortment of colors.They don't smear the text you are highlighting over.Clicky (retractable) highlighters are more convenient than capped ones.If you need highlighters these are a good package to buy.,1
"I agree with the last reviewer. Cover doesn't line up right resulting in unevenly sharpened pencils. Piece of junk! I am so tired of playing with it, came on to Amazon today so I could order something else. Saw this one near top of the results and am now all riled up. I'm sure I bought it because of the 4 stars. Buyer beware!",0
"Stretch wrap is a fantastic packaging product. I know that there are very few people who has this item in their house, but especially for those who has a lot of stuff that needs to be put in the storage, you will find that this product is extremely useful.There is no adhesives so there is no need to remove any unwanted sticky residues when it is time to unpack your things. The clear plastic wrap sticks to itself. They are available in different widths, but this is the perfect size if you want to manage packing by yourself. I do not have to use a pair of scissors, all I have to do is to pull it. The wrap is very flexible and at the same time is very strong.When disassembling furniture, I use it to wrap the screws and bolts on the furniture legs to make sure not to misplaced them. They also prevent the furniture's surfaces from getting scratch.I have tried 3 different brands and they all works great. The price for a 5"" x 1000' varies around 10-13$.",1
"Purchased this model 3 weeks ago, the answerer would not work. Exchanged it for another again it would not pick-up, play message or record incoming call. It will also be taken back and exchanged for a phone with caller id. Will go back to voice mail. Too bad because this model if it had operated as stated would have been easy to use. I called GE and they suggested that I mail it to them, but I don't know how long it would take them to get it back me and if it would work even thenalso I don't think I should have to pay s&h; plus ins. on a new phone that should work. I gave 1 star because the is no option for 0 stars.",0
I just took this with me for two weeks of study abroad and the battery is still working great! I found it very useful!!!!,1
this is a great flash card with a buttload of space on it but my internet tablet doesnt recognise it :( but i can use it on other things like my digital picture frame! not a big loss...,1
Battery life is terrible. They need a lithium ion battery for this phone. Get out of the old technology.,0
Stay away from this phone. It is one of the worst phones I ever purchased.,0
"Phone works better than any cordless we have had, battery is now nearly completely dead after only 6 months of use. Trying to decide whether to spend $12 for a new battery or $20 for a new phone.",0
"This paper worked very well for me. I have printed maps and satellite photos of hiking trails on this paper using my inkjet printer. The images look great. Out of curiosity, I tested its weatherproof-ness by running it under the faucet. The only way I could get a little ink to run was if I heavily rubbed an area with my thumb while under running water. But even then, the image didn't smear because the loosened ink didn't re-adhere to the paper. This paper is also very strong and resists tearing. If you try to rip it like normal paper, it will only stretch a bit. Folds easily.",1
"Can't head calling party voice most of the time. No sure I can call it a phone with this behaviorAfter pulling out and putting in battery to reset phone, battery indicator shows all low even though before pulling out it was fully changedRoom monitor is completely useless unless I keep it attached to my ears.Deleting caller Id entry from one handset doesn't delete from other handset. You have to delete manually from both.",0
"The Panasonic phone we had for years served us well but this one seems to have more power, cleaner sound and works for longer without constant charging. Also, it's nice to do away with totally proprietary batteries and go with rechargeable AAAs. May not be as easy to understand for people who have problems with pressing more than one button to do things like read the caller ID, but overall seems to work and sound better than I expected for a reasonable price and is expandable. Good phone for the money.",1
"These Avery labels do exactly what they're supposed to.They feed perfectly, are perfectly spaced on the label sheet, are easy to peel and position.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Tools; then Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5160Type in what you want on the labeland print.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking labels. I use them as return address labels, because this size is ""taller"" than many and allows an extra line or two on the label.Really!--you won't be diaappointed--these labels live up to the Avery reputation.",1
This is the THIRD one of these I've bought. They never last a full year....just quit! Note that I sharpen no more than a dozen pencils a week!,0
"I am a teacher who spends a lot of time sharpening pencils everyday. I don't let my students sharpen pencils because it is a time consuming disruption. I thought the ""School Pro Heavy Duty"" sharpener would be perfect, based on the words in the product's name. Unfortunately, I went through two of these sharpeners in one school year. For my second purchase, because each unit cost me $50 at the time, I purchased a service agreement where I could replace the unit if it failed, free of charge. Well, that store went out of business. I now have two broken sharpeners sitting in my garage.I found it frustrating that despite the auto-stop function, pencils sharpened with fat points, which caused bulk and made it easy for the pencil leads to break off. I was constantly having to resharpen pencils because of this. And that was difficult too. Because the sharpener did not do a very good job of re-sharpening broken pencils. It took at least 2 tries. I was hoping that this kind of sharpener would just sharpen pencils...thin enough to write with and not break off. For my students, thinner points are harder to break off than bulkier ones.My other frustration is that it did a bad job of sharpening color pencils. Again, it would sharpen fat points, creating more bulk and thus broken color pencil leads. Color pencils have a softer lead. If the sharpener cannot handle these kinds of pencils, it should say so in its packaging/product description.Lead pencils and colored pencils are a mainstay in my elementary classroom. I lose my momentum in teaching when I have to spend time ""fixing"" the sharpener to sharpen broken pencils. A new school year is upon me, and I now have to research other brands to meet my needs. Bummer, because I have used other X-Acto brands for technical drawing purposes, and they have lasted me for years.",0
We bought this and 3 months later two of the clippy things that hold down money broke off. For the price it's not worth it.,0
"Linked with my cell phone fine, quality was good. One handset worked fine the other was DOA. Called customer service three times and was told to do the same thing each time, didn't fix it. Finally had to send it back to Thompson (GE). Now they tell me it will be another 4-6 weeks for a replacement. They hide behind canned responses and are unwilling to do anything to expedite for their defective product. Today I asked for a supervisor and listened to the line ring for over ten minutes, no answer, finally had to hang up. Tried emailing through Thompsons web site, just another canned response telling me to call the same customer service line that didn't help to begin with!! Good idea but the customer service is not worth it. It's turned be off this phone, if I do get a replacement I think it will be sold at a yard sale...I expected better from GE.",0
"I have purchased several pieces of Sauder furniture in the past and have never been disappointed. The cabinet is attractive and very well made. While it is somewhat time consuming to assemble, it is worth the effort.",1
We used this tape to pack big boxes going overseas and it worked great. There was none of the bad smell from the tape that was mentioned in other reviews. It has good adhesion and sufficient thickness to make for a strong tape.,1
We went ttogether and bought this item for my boss as a Chrismtmas gift. He was very pleased with it and has quickly figured out how to use it and get the info into his PC. It seems easy to use and I sure he is going to find it useful. Looks like we made a good decision!,1
The phone arrived in a timely fashion. We had a problem with the ringer and receiving calls for a couple days which we fixed by running the wiring through our caller id receiver. I think that the wires we received were faulty. Other than that the phone works fine.,0
What a really nice mouse pad. It looked good in the photo but WOW! When you get it it looks even better! Very impressive,1
"Bought 2 of these phones, neither of them worked. They distorted my voice so that the person I was trying to talk to couldn't understand me.",0
"Saw reviews here here and bought. Nice feature set. Sound and range fine. Like the look too. Remote units perform well. At one month and a day the answering machine failed for line 1, but worked fine for line two. Spent close to an hour on the phone with Uniden about the problem before they agreed to replace the unit - for $10 fee.Replacement unit from Uniden arrived quickly, but was a factory serviced unit, which failed in the same manner, line 1 answering machine failure, about two months later.",0
"I didn't use the included software, but created a database with templates for printing on the 8.5"" x 11"" sheets. Is easy to get artist, title, 30 song titles, release year, and a 1"" square cover art rendition printed on the labels.You'll need a device to apply the labels correctly. The labels look best on silver or pure white topped CDr blanks. Silver with silver printing is acceptable, but the lettering will still be visible through the labels in good light.In addition to the two circular labels there are four other labels per sheet. Skinny ones for the edge of jewel cases, and larger rectangular ones.Had to edit my review and remove stars. Some labels are cut differently. The difference (~1/8"") caused my carefully aligned graphics to print off center and run off label edges. This is a quality control issue.",0
"The phone is just okay.. Not nearly as good as calling through the computer.. it drops calls all the time, even if you are standing next to the router. It also freezes all the time and has to be reset to work. With that said, for the price it's ok. Nothing to write home about, but it'll do.",0
"The phone is labeled as Telephone and Accessory Handset but that is not what is on the box. It says very clearly ""does not work independently"" and it does not say that on product description.I have a regular GE 29267GE3-B and that is why I chose GE over Panasonic. Sadly I have to return it because I only need one phone and this is a phone to buy if you already have the base station and what to add another handset.",0
"Any map you can buy at a store that is halfway decent will run you at least $20. I was very surprised to find that to be the case as I was looking around before buying this one online.This map is beautiful, colorful, and not laminated. It sounds dorky, but I wanted a world map so that me and my husband could document with push pins all the places we've gone (we have a big trip planned this summer).It is perfect - a great size, and very attractive. This isn't something you'll wince at every time you see it hanging on your wall.Definitely recommend!",1

"These did not work to hang my plain, unframed posters. I used at least 4 on each poster, after cleaning off the surface they would hang on. After about an hour, my posters had flopped off and fallen. At first I thought it was the textured cinderblock that I was trying to hang the posters on. However, after I tried hanging them with new mounting squares on the smooth wood of my closet, they still fell of within an hour. Perhaps it's the two surfaces I tried to hang posters on, but these did not work for me at all.",0
"This phone is a piece of junk. There is static no matter where I place it and It sounds like people are talking under water. I have never had a phone this bad, the problem is I didn't get around to hooking it up for about a month and a half, so now I guess it will make a nice yard sale item.",0
"This phone is unusable. Looks nice, but unusable. There is a horrible echo when you speak. It sounds like a half duplex phone - people's voices cut out on the other end when you start speaking on your end. Just horrible.I wish I could find a usable cordless phone w/ answering machine.",0
"Unfortunately the 'boost' for hearing impaired only acts on a portion of the frequency spectrum, and is not a 'volume boost' of the overall loudness...you are still limited in the volume range to the inherent volume control. It does little to improve audibility for my in-laws (95 and 90 years young). Neverthess, they do not have a fundamental problem hearing with this phone, and my mother in law is getting quite hard of hearing.",0
"I LOVE these little stickers. I use them to number my baby's bottles when I send them to daycare, so they'll know which ones to use first. They're bright enough to attract attention without being obnoxious, and they remove very easily, even when I forget to remove them before running the bottles through the diswasher. They still stick when I want them to and remove easily when I want them off.",1
"I have been using these types of files for many years in offices and at home. They are indespensable along with regular capacity Pendaflex folders for maintaining files. However, it seems that Pendaflex has recently significantly reduced the quality of the materials used to the point of making them flimsy and not functional. When these folders are loaded the metal bars bow and bend making them hard to handle. The bars are so thin that they act like a knife edge and cut into the file drawer rails instead of sliding along them as is needed. Older Pendaflex folders I have still slide fine along the rails. Also, the paper material of the new folders is considerable thinner than the old folders and I doubt they will last as long as the older, better made folders. I will not buy these folders again and am looking for a studier replacement.",0
"These are the best notebooks I've ever used and I've used a lot of notebooks over the years. I love the soft cover version as I have a great, custom-fitted leather cover from Renaissance Art that makes it look and function like a million bucks. The beauty in all the Moles is their stitched binding that allows it to lie flat for writing. As a fountain pen user, I also appreciate the slight ""tooth"" in the off-white paper along with the visually comfortable neutral toned rules. I drag it everywhere and order several at a time, I will never be caught without one at the ready!",1
Its really cheap. It looks so much nicer on the web then in person. REALLY disappointed and the shipping is way too expensive.,1

Great price. Can not tell its a recon unit. Better than new because of the price! Thanks,1
"I have been having this phone for about one year. I works fine, but it is so combersome to use that it is not really worth buying it. Perhaps the manufacturer paid so much attention to the non-phone features that they forgot the basics. Pressing the buttons has an annoying delay, the caller id has problems displaying the names unless they are already stored in the phone directory, etc. But the really weird one is that I was unable to use the call waiting feature until few days ago. Apparently to flash the hook you have to press the &quot;mem&quot; button (nowhere mentioned in the manual ... oh yeah it's intuitive!) and you have to do that for some amount of time, not too long not too short. Until I found this &quot;feature&quot;, I tried to use other phones in the house to avoid missing calls. I buy a phone for the phone features, not for the pda features. I do not carry my cordless phone to the office! I could care less for the pda features, but I expect the call waiting to work in a &quot;normal&quot; way. Is that hard?",0

This tape has little or no magnetic strength. It won't even stick to itself!,0
I can't say as I would reccommend this phone to anyone. We've had one for less than 6 months and now both phone displays are dead and unusable. Getting it fixed requires that the entire unit be returned whne there is nothing wrong with the base unit. If it's expandable then I don't understand why this entire system has to be returned to fix handsets. Obvioulsy it is not what it is advertised to be.,0
"I've owned the shredder for about a month and so far, so good. It has performed as promised and advertised.",1
I paid $130.00 for this unit and 30.00 for an extra handset. I have used them since November and all I can say is they have the worst range I have ever seen on a cordless phone. Even worst than the original cordless units that came out years ago. I consistently get readings saying I am out of range even when I am standing next to another charging unit and phone. The static is unbearable to the point it sounds like I am on a cell phone and I have to apologize to the people I am speaking to because they only hear every other word. The unit's features are minimal and the ringer choices are annoying. I paid to much for the unit and only purchase it because of the reviews. So either mine is a dud or someone has been feeding their reviews for the product.,0
"Paper has nice quality, as well as a low price. Packaging was neat and no damaged corners (as some other reviews have encountered).",1
"The Pentel line has several excellent products but this one is a favorite of mine. It has a solid heft shaft that's easy to grasp and this is particularly important to me as I have MS and am inclined to have difficulty holding on to slim, angular objects. The broader tip and thick, black ink come close to approximating a fountain pen but without the ""drag"" that sort of writing instrument has. I have engraved writing papers and it looks just fine on them whereas a ""ball point"" would look too casual. Also, this has a deeper black in that's more easily read. All in all, a very successful product and one I'm pleased to suggest.",1

"I was looking for a lapdesk for my 17"" PowerBook that would help keep it cool while it was in my lap, but would also be sturdy enough to hold it when I put it down. I saw this one online and it is perfectly made for the PowerBook (or MacBook Pro). Unlike the cheapies, it is sturdy and comfortable and keeps the computer cool. It even stays level (or relatively so, as it is slightly angled) when I put it down on my couch, so I don't have to worry about it sliding to one side or the other, which my old one used to do. The only thing I wish it had was a slide out tray or area for a mouse. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a Mac and even to anyone with any other brand of laptop. Just be sure to get the right size for your machine.",1

They had different foil stampsand a few pencils were shorter ( which means they were Used).Make sure you get what you ordered, (I didn't get any Artstix in my package) It's not a debate about the usability of Artstix --just give me what I paid for!All in all, I felt like someone was trying to pull a fast one at my convenience.

"I had high expectations for this mouse pad. The first thing I noticed is that it feels ""slippery"" when moving the mouse. The packaging says jersey-cloth surface. Then jersey-cloth must be a very slippery synthetic cloth. My old mouse pad has a natural cotton/synthetic mix and has a lot better traction, so you feel better control of the mouse. The second thing I noticed was the strong ""tire"" smell. I read the reviews, but I did not think it was going to be such an annoying smell.",0
"I agree with the review written by Lars. This tape is worthless. It doesn't stick to the boxes. It sticks when you apply it but when you come back a couple of hours later it has come off.

"It writes overhead, on oil and water, it flows nicely, has a nice color but it blobs every time I use it. By the time I'm finished writing a check or note it's full of ink smears. It's not just this one, they're all like that, they all smear and blob. I have a drawer full of Fisher ink refills that blob. I've had to retire the Fisher pen because of this.",0

"My issue with this phone is the keypad failure. If I needed to dial 911 I wouldn't be able since the #1 no longer works. Initially, we really liked the phone, which has great features, so we recommended it to my brother-in-law. Within six months of purchase, he mentioned how his #1 wasn't working. We told him our phone still worked great, but before long we,too, began experiencing problems with the keypad. My brother-in-law has already replaced his MD451 and we will have to, soon, since now the #1 and #3 aren't working.",0
"While I have given the belkin repeater/range expander a very good rating, this item is not worth even trying. As far as the hype 'we have tested this phone and it is clear as any landline' the person who tested was either lying or needs a hearing test. Difficult to connect to networks that are unsecured even though your signal strength is high, the tiny buttons on the phone and the Terrible Quality of the audio which sounds just like my regulat skype usb phone that I use w my laptop.Because I complained of the bad quality of the reception and audio, the 'level 2 tech, another so-called tech from India or Pakistan suggested I do a firmware upgrade which I did right w the tech on the phone; after doing this the phone was even worse, sound cutting in and out, and even worse muddy audio. They offered to send me a 'replacement' for 'ruining' my phone but they wanted to charge my credit card first before shipping a'new one'(I doubt that) to me. So I told them I would be posting some bad reviews, and here is one.DON'T TRY THIS BELKIN WIFI PHONE, you will be sorry.",0
"The file arrived in a box that fell apart when we began opening it. There is a lower shelf. It arrived severely bent. This is a very thin-walled item. That's good if you have to move it around, because it is light, but not so good that it bends and distorts so easily. The lid works fine.",0
"The best thing about this phone is that it has broken 15 months after we bought it. Thank heavens! Now we can toss it out without guilt.One of the big annoyances with this phone is that it's blinking lights aren't terribly logical. It has two, one to indicate that you got a call, and the other to indicate that you have a new message. But the ""New Call"" light is HUGE and blinks every time the phone rings, even if you answered it. It is as if the phone says, ""Deal With Me!"" Every single time it ever rings. It is annoying to have to press a button every time the phone has rung just to make it stop shouting at me.A much smaller light blinks when there is a new message, and is just red to indicate the phone is on. Here I can understand a blinking light when you have a new message. Oddly enough, the light is smaller and less noticable than that New Call Light.And did I mention that the caller ID mostly refuses to display who is calling? Sometimes on about the fourth ring it will flash the name of the person, but rarely before, and only sometimes. I am paying, what, $7 per month to the phone company for caller ID but the phone won't give up the information. It does, however, capture the name and number of the caller if I don't ever answer the phone.",0
"For anyone wanting to bind books or other documents in a professional looking manner, this is the machine for you. It's very easy to operate. However, I would advise stapling your documents together before placing them in a Thermobind Cover for hot-glue binding.",1
"I have owned this phone over a year, and it is a very good phone. The sound is clear, it's easy to program, it's durable, and the price is right. The only drawback is that I get less than 7 hours of talk-time, and sometimes it starts beeping to be recharged during a conversation, but I am probably on the phone too long! I bought this to replace an AT&amp;T phone which was horrible and never worked right. I am very happy with it.",1
"I was pretty pleased initially the the price, features, and phone quality. Everything matched my expectations when it arrived except for the speakerphone microphone. I have to believe it was faulty because it would not work unless you placed your mouth less than a foot away from it and spoke loudly. It didn't fade as you got further away, it just stopped working. I returned the phone and switched to a unit that had wireless handsets to compliment the corded base. Amazon was great on the return and it remains one of my favorite on-line vendors.",0
"I don't know how I got bargained into buying these horrible pens, but these are THE WORST GEL PENS THAT I EVER OWNED. I actually got a 2-pack for 1 dollar at Walgreens, but it wasn't worth it. I am so annoyed by these pens that I wrote a review on amazon to tell people not to get tricked into buying these terrible pens.Pros:-Look nice and grip is good.-I got a 2 pack for 1 dollarCons:-They only write on a perfectly hard leveled surface otherwise the ink skips on soft or wrinkled paper,etc-Once it skips, it makes the indentation, making it impossible to fill in with the same pens. I have used 10 cent pens that will fill in the indentation it skipped while the Uni-ball wouldn't.Because of those two flaws, it makes it the most aggravating pen I ever used. If you decide to buy this pen because of the savings, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",0
"If I hadn't already pitched this, it would have been a great produuct for a video review.The vacuum seal never worked...ever...that means you needed two people to work it. One person had to hold the sharpener down, the other to insert the pencil and turn the crank. Awfully crowded, and awfully complicated just to sharpen a pencil. Because it never mounted correctly the pencil and sharpener weren't stable so the sharpening wasn't evenly done to all sides of the pencil. Sometimes it seemed the leads must have cracked from the torquing because they would fall out if you did get the pencil sharpened to a point.Wasted money to buy the sharpener and wasted money replacing the ruined pencils.",0
"I like the phone, it is very pretty and works well. I did ask the buyer what it was made of...I was told Porcelain and Metal. When I received the phone I found that the handset was mostly plastic. The middle when you hold the phone is Porcelain the rest of the handset is plastic including the parts that look like metal. That was a bit disappointing. If I was planning to use it on a regular basis I would rather it was all Porcelain and Metal. Overall for the price it is a nice phone, it has controls for the ringer high/low/off and high/low volume control for the receiver. I bought it as an Emergency only phone, it does not need electricity to work. I love all shades of purple and is one of the big reasons I bought it. Although Lavender is misspelled(Lavendar)in the name of the phone and it took me forever to find it the second time I tried to look it up!",0
"This tape is the best in my opinion for packaging, and made in the USA. Can't go wrong with that!",1
"I actually bought one these from Belkin for free, just had to pay shipping, but of course this was a few years ago and now it was starting to rip, full of dead skin and I washed it many times, one to many.So I thought it was time for a new mouse pad and so I decided to get the same one that I got and it just works, it's simple mouse pad, mouse slides nice and smooth and grips well to the desk!I don't know what else I can say, it's just a mousepad! It does it's job as a mouse pad and does it well.",1
"I ordered a pair of these monitor stands and I couldn't be less satisfied. First off, like the other reviews say, they look nice in the photos, but in reality they're shoddy and poorly built. One of the stands was missing two of the screws holding the white plastic to the silver frame.However, the worst part about these is that they're not even remotely close to level, nor are they uniform in height. I have two monitors and I literally had to put a stack of about 30 sheets of paper under each side (60 total) of one to make the second stand match the height of the first stand, and then I had to shim one side of it by folding two pieces of paper 5 times and putting the under the right side of the two metal pieces. The other one had to have two pieces of paper folded 4 times under one side to get it level. Now I have a bunch of paper on my desk which doesn't exactly look nice, which is what these stands were supposed to deliver.These stands may look nice from a distance, but the white plastic is not flush with the metal, they're not level, they're not uniform in height, there is no craftsmanship here and they're unquestionably not worthy of being compared to Apple products, a company that actually takes pride in their work.I give this product a well deserved one star. If I could give it zero stars, I would. An unfortunate waste of time and money.",0
"Archival Gold products were a huge disappointment, these markers just beaded up and smeared. Also, I bought their CDs and DVDs. CDs were fair. DVDs had to be mostly thrown out.",0
"This phone is fantastic for two people with a broadband internet connection to talk to each other. I use this phone for calls to canada which were running me 2 cents a minute using a phone card, now they are free, I can talk for three or four hours without spending a penny. Instant messaging just got an upgrade.",1
I installed this underneath my marker boards for my home office. It's a very handy item to have. Works just as described.,1
My son bought me the HP DC3000 for Christmas and I hooked it up to a Dell 4500s which contained everything the system demanded including Windows XP and 256mg of ram. My system would not recognize the unit. I spent a day trying many of the fixes offered on the HP website and it still would not function. I called and was on the phone with a techie for almost two hours trying different fixes - nothing! I then connected it to my wife's PC which is newer than mine and it still would not recognize the HP drive. The unit was returned today.,0
"The Vtech looks nice and has really cool functions, but the problem is that the sound quality is really bad and choppy. Also is has lesser range than the Panasonic 2.4 Ghz phones. In fact, my old 900 mhz phone has better sound quality and greater range than the Vtech. Please do not buy this phone...it was a complete waste of money. I had to sell the phone (with the 3 additional handsets) on auction just to get rid of it. Vtechs only look nice...but thats about it.",0
"The tape is hard to find locally.Apparently, graphics tend to be done more electronically than manually.I have another use for it - along with white tape, I use it for highway pavement markings on a scale model railroad.",1
"Since I live in a very tiny house, I thought I didn't really need two handsets, but it's actually been quite nice to have two. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any trouble with the wall mount (it isn't very attractive, however). When I read other reviewers' comments that they wished the handset buttons were lighted, I didn't give it much thought, but actually it really matters, and that's why I didn't give the phone the fifth star. I hadn't realized how many phone calls I make in the dark. Most importantly, though, the reception is good. I can vist my brother at his nearby house and still get my phone calls.",1
I love these pens. The convenience of having the pen and highlighter in one is great.,1
"The Franklin Merrian-Websters Speaking collegiate Dictionary, 11th Ediction - SCD1870 does everything it claims. I purchased it for my grandson to start 4th grade. He struggles with spelling, and I wanted to help reduce the frustration he feels when trying to look up words in a standard dictionary. He loves this device! Although it is not a child's dictionary, its features make it usable by even this young boy. He can type in a phonetic spelling and find the correct spelling for words he wants to use in his written work. Even though the definitions may be advanced, he can look up words in the definition instantly! His vocabularly is growing swiftly while his frustration level is decreasing. In addition, he learns new words every time he turns the Franklin on! He and I play the spelling games and have a lot of fun together while learning at the same time. His mother is overjoyed because my grandson can enter his weekly spelling words into the Franklin and practice on his own. Spelling is no longer overwhelming. In my professional capacity as psychotherapist and specialist consultant to families about learning disabilities, I am now recommending the Franklin as an assitive device for children at the right reading level. Thanks Franklin.",1
"I would have bought this at the regular price, because it is certainly worth it--but I got this when it was 50% off at Amazon.com--great deal, to be sure. I've been a big fan of Epson products for the last fifteen years and--along with Amazon.com--they do not disappoint.",1
"Casio has been making calculators since the abacus was replaced (even tho it is still being used in some places, like MIT) so it is not surprising that this device works very well and does what it is asked to do.",1
"I bought this product because I just wanted a cheap dictionary that fit easily inside my books for whenever I came across a word that I wanted to see the definition for. However, I personally found it to be a waste of money. I barely got any use out of it, because nearly every time I used it half of the letters wouldn't work on the keyboard, thus rendering it practically useless. I tried resetting it and replacing the battery, both of which made it work the first time I used it again, then it quit working again after that. If you're like me and you just want a portable, convenient dictionary that fits inside your books, I would suggest spending a little more money on a better quality one because this one just isn't worth wasting your time or money on.",0
"This is basically just a piece of plastic with slots in it that folds. Nothing more and nothing less.Sure there are grips on it to keep a computer from supposedly sliding off, but they do not work. I thought (by the picture) that they would have some sort of legs on it, but there is no legs at all on this.I was very disappointed. I merely use this for a tray to use my mouse and that is it.",0

"The Magic Rub vinyl graphite removal system is the Cadillac of graphite-error management equipment. Applied manually to the surface (not the edges) of a sheet of paper whereupon an erroneous graphite expression has been imbued, and subjected to oscillating or circular motions, this sytem will remove that graphite with ruthless dispatch and minimum effort. This is the one that all the A-List professional bookkeepers use, thus you absolutely have to know it's the very best.",1
"I was impressed by this stapler when we initially had one. However, it broke down after a month. We thought that maybe we just bought a lemon. The second piece we bought also broke down after a month of regular use. And we just normally staple an average of 10 pages or below.",0

I thought maybe my phone would be different. Wrong, my friend! I am going to return it because it is aggravating. My caller id waiting also does not pick up my calls. I do not recommend this phone to anyone. So those that do read this review, please take heed to what we are saying. Vtech I hope you read these reviews and take the criticism and time to upgrade these phones. How bout throwing in some free ones for those that may give you another chance.",0

"FINALLY, I wish I would have found these a month ago when I started selling. They are the cheapest price for self-adhesive shipping labels anywhere! And to boot, free shipping! They work just like normal paper on my standard ink jet printer. The day I received them someone bought one of my items so I was able to test them out and they worked flawlessly. Later I realized that you can get them for free UPS though but only if you use them for UPS.EDIT: I noticed the price went up from 8.21 to 12.60 so that changes my original statement that these are the cheapest labels around. You can get them from the USPS Postal Store for 9 dollars plus shipping. WATCH THE PRICES AND ONLY BUY WHEN THEY ARE DOWN.",1

Drawer fronts poorly constructed. Drawer rails flimsy. Drawers didn't fit frame. Too much work invested in assembly to take apart and send back. Had great potential but didn't square up.,0
"TEN times better at holding charge than our last expandable system, which was a Panasonic. We loved the Panasonic phones EXCEPT for the fact that the battery lost its charge way too often. I like the programmable songs for different callers and the fact that you can sync your saved numbers from one handset to another so that you don't have to manually enter them separately. Talk time is pretty long too!",1
I was skeptical of this product due to other reviews about other storage bags of similar price (and no-name brand). But I researched the seller and took a chance. Turned out to be a great buy. The bag was really sturdy and held five heavy wool blankets. Zipper was sturdy. Shipment was quick. Great service from shipper. Thank you-great size and buy at a reasonable price.,1

"I am not commenting on the performance of these highlighters because I will be returning them. I was hoping for some slightly less traditional colors, as pictured in the product page. However, I received ordinary highlighters in ordinary shades of blue, green, pink, yellow and purple. The part number listed on the page is the same as on the highlighters. I am quite disappointed as I was really looking forward to the interesting colors pictured.",0
"I got this phone cheap, as it has been discontinued. The phone is nice, durable, easy to use, and convenient. However, installing the phone will 'hijack' your audio capabilities, meaning that you can't listen to music or watch the news after install. Even if you adjust the Skype default audio settings, it is still buggy. One work-around is to create a separate log-in user profile and DONT install the phone on the other profile. depending on whether i want to use the phone OR listen to shows/music, I just switch between profiles.",0
I specifically picked out this shredder because it was suppose to shred CD/DVD and it gets jammed every single time you put a CD in. I tried multiples just in case it was just bad luck on that first disk. It shreds paper fantastically but I could have gotten a regular everyday shredder that did just paper for a hell of a lot cheaper. Definitely not worth the price don't buy it.,0
"I purchased two of these phones for a friend who was in need of a basic phone. She is thrilled with them. It has a few features that she was looking for, like the speaker phone and volume controls for that feature. The clarity is great. When she has called me, it sounds as if she is sitting right next to me talking. This is just what she wanted and needed, a no frills phone that works!",1
ergonomics person at work just dropped one of these off at my desk... and i can tell from 5 minutes of use that it's a completely useless piece of plastic.WHY they gave me this instead of investing an additional $15 into something nicer is beyond me.,0

"We have used this for several years and almost never have prints made outside the home. This ""wax"" process eliminates smudging or staining of the pictures. You can literally soak them in water and they will be fine. Just try that with your DM printed photos from other printers (HP, I mean you). The printer itself is quirky though, and you end up wasting prints on occasion when a ribbon runs out or you don't program it just right and print two per page instead of two single prints. It happens, believe me. Still, it is a great unit and about the same cost as pro developing. That being said, I am finding it harder and harder to obtain printer ribbons and paper kits. I suspect Kodak is going to stop making the replacement cartridges, perhaps because of grief they are getting from their pro-developers seeing their market share shrink. Face it, Target could not do any better than this in a 4X6 on Kodak paper so by selling directly to the homeowner, Kodak is cutting out the middleman. At this point, I would seriously think hard about buying a printer unit, either new or used, unless Kodak makes their intentions for paper and ink supply known. Plus, the cartridges are not recyclable. I tried. Make sure you buy a few extra kits just in case the become obsolete.",0
"I purchased this phone because I am living overseas and Skype is the only means I have of affordabley communicating with my family and friends in the U.S. The phone appears to work fine, needs some user-friendly updates, but overall serves its purpose. The problem is Phillips customer service--in November 2007, seven months after I purchased and received the phone, the charger completely died. Two times I've spoken with Phillips customer service representatives, who have mailed a new charger to my APO address; however, mysteriously, I have never received a new charger. In the first case, I waited 6 weeks before requesting they re-send the new charger. Now, four months later, I'm still waiting for the ostensible second charger, having received nothing from Phillips in the mail. Our APO service has been flawless to date, and vendors have had no problem mailing anything to us. Packages predominantly arrive between 2-4 weeks after placing an order, and there are no restrictions that would preclude us from being able to receive this phone charger (after all, it was through the APO address that we first received the phone). Additionally, the government records when packages are received. They have no record of a package for us from Phillips. So what's going on? Is Phillips lying to us about mailing a phone charger? Their product is completely useless to us right now, and coincidentally, we are arriving near to the one year warranty date. My opinion is that if you're going to spend this much money on a piece of technology that needs to be reliable, because it will serve a vital purpose in your life, then the lack of customer service assistance from Phillips is enough to discourage me from buying this product again or recommending it to friends and family. I encourage you to keep looking for a phone like this, but produced by a different company. We will not purchase a Phillips phone product like this again, after experiencing this problem, and four months later, having a simple problem remain unresolved. It makes me wonder what is next to fail, AFTER our warranty has expired.",0

I wanted to use this mouse across three different systems (2 laptops and 1 desktop) without much hassle -- NOW it looks like I am better off having three mouse at home rather than using this bluetooth mouse.3. The worst part comes with the scroller -- its lousy and it does not even respond at all. Tried all scroll setting in vein. (mouse pointer works ok though!)4.

"UPDATE (June '08): There's now a better driver that finally lets me print from my regular applications (at least from FileMaker Pro; I assume it'll work with others). The P-Touch Editor interface is also improved and compatible with OS 10.5 -- so, all and all, it's moved from a 2-star label-printer for Mac to at least a 4-star.

"I sit in this chair at work. We just got new offices with all new chairs and I was very excited about having a comfortable chair to sit in. I realize you can't know how comfortable a chair will be unless you sit in it for at least 30 minutes, so I don't blame the people who picked this chair. But everyone needs to know that this chair is absolutely horrible. I've been at work for about an hour and a half today, and already I am literally writhing in pain. My neck and back are killing me - but so are my arms. My arms?! What is that?!We've had these chairs for a little over a month and I keep hoping I'll get used to it, that it will get more comfortable. But no. And it's really disheartening to know that I don't have hope of changing chairs for the next several years. :( It's really sad to be at work all day and just be flat out in pain.I wonder if one of those back pillows would help...probably not as there is barely enough room to sit without feeling like you are about to fall off. The other reviewer is right - this chair literally rejects you.Update: It's been a year now. This chair is still HORRIBLE. I take advil or tylenol usually every day. Isn't that ridiculous? Sometimes I get so upset thinking about how awful these chairs are and that I have to sit in it 5 days a week. Please don't buy this chair for you or your employees - it's evil.",0
"Excellent media storage. Fits either video boxes or DVDs or CDs perfectly. Full-extension drawer glides.

Was using a cheap generic mouse pad from several years ago with a Razer Diamondback mouse and the difference is HUGE! I use photoshop and like to do some gaming and the difference is massive from what I used to have. What I had read from other reviewers is that it needs a very clean surface so as not to shift so after prepping the pad and the glass it holds firmly. The surface is very different from anything I have used before and the mouse feels like it's floating and moves effortlessly and I'll never have to worry about losing tracking because it will never fall off the pad due to it's large size. Arrived *unfolded* with excellent packaging. Great buy!,1
"I got this mousepad to use for my HTPC. Having a stiff mousepad allows you to use it in a lot of unusual situations, such as on a couch or on your lap.The surface is quite smooth; in fact, if the mouse pad is not perfectly level, the mouse has the tendency to slide off of it. It is also large and shaped well enough that I don't often find myself hitting the edge of the pad.",1

(Surprisingly these range from $6-$30 -- shop carefully!) I borrowed such an adapter, but without the right driver, the adapter doesn't provide Windows a COM port, and so it doesn't do the job. Pelouze tech support had no workarounds for me.Second, once you have a working connection, you need pay to download rates. Actually, the first download is free with the scale, but you have register on Pelouze's web site and download three separate items. Future rate downloads cost something (price unknown). Add this on to your operating costs.Third, the scale's concept of rate scales is limited to the USPS tariffs before the May 2008 changes. The scale doesn't have a way to give you different rates for small vs large envelopes below 3.5 oz. It doesn't have a rate step for the new 3.0-3.5 oz band. For those, you still need a printed rate card. It doesn't handle any rates but USPS (which is a bummer for me, I live in Canada).So, I've come to the conclusion that this gift is only useful to me as a scale, without any postage calculation possible.As a scale, it has its strong points. It's a compact, sleek design. It measures up to 5 pounds, with 0.1 oz accuracy. That's plenty for my small office use. It runs off a 9v battery (not included), and shuts off automatically. I just keep it on a shelf, and pull it down when I need it.It also has weak points. It's a pity they didn't include even a 9v battery, let alone the optional $17 AC adaptorPelouze ADPT2 AC Adapter for Digital Postal Scales. It's a pity that it can't switch between ounces and grams (I mail both USPS and Canada Post letters, so I really need both). It's a pity I can't load my own rates into it. It's a pity that it doesn't handle UPS, FedEx, or other services.But mostly, it's a pity that it's a $70 product which does no more than $20 or $30 products. I received it as a gift, so it's worth every penny *I* paid for it. You, however, might want to keep shopping.",0
"it matches the color of my shelves. It's not the thickest or most sturdy of all, but it's very inexpensive. It doesn't have writing or logo in the front or back so it doesn't look obnoxious. All and all, i like them it's well worth the money i spent.",1
"It is very hard to find this item and I have searched all kinds of stores for awhile with no sucess. I found them here online and they are just what I need to keep change, and small parts handy and quiet as I work/move. They are a better quality than stores as well-softer and very easy to open.",1
I've tried using this product twice now and I had trouble getting the release paper off and made a big mess. The small size like this apparently came with the wrong instructions but the instructions with this larger size wasn't a whole lot better. I had no luck with it maybe it's my iron but I'm giving up trying maybe you will have better luck then me.,0
"I bought this phone at Christmas and waited to review as I wanted to get in a couple of months of use before submitting my review. So far the phone has been reliable. Charge time is more than sufficient. I have 2 teenagers who constantly leave it off the base and it hasn't run out on me yet. There are plenty of features, answering machine is great - messages are very legible and very easy to retrieve, delete, save, etc messages. The speaker phone picks up my voice from another room - person on the other end of the line said I was weak but they could definitely hear me. I could hear them just fine. The back light on the cordless keypad is nice! Thought I would use the keypad on the base a lot more than I have. Probably could have lived without that feature. That's all the good stuff. What I don't like is that there is a slight echo on my end of the cordless. The other person can hear me just fine. Also, the date/time consistently looses time which is annoying as I have to keep reseting it. Overall, I like the phone, the features and am satisfied with the quality. I would buy this product again.",1

"I asked for this pencil for Christmas to help me with my horrendous handwriting. This pencil far exceeded my expectations. not only did it prove to be reliable, but its perfect weight towards the front makes this an incredibly smooth writing tool. I actually love using it just for the sake of feeling its smoothness. I do use the retractable head. I hope the retracting mechanism lasts, but, for now, I love the option.",1
"After reading all the reviews, I hope I will like the phone. I really wanted an expandable phone system, unfortunately, not like other brands, you have to buy an extra for the MD681. Target doesn't carry it, Good Guys and Office Depot doesn't have it either. Good Guys and Office Depot personal didn't even know that this phone exist. Anyway. It would be helpful if anybody could tell me where I can buy an extention. You can e-mail me @:TinyTreasures7@msn.com. Thank you so much.",0
"I've been using Wausau's AstroBright's papers for about 14 years now, mostly for flyers in college and such. I purchased them this time around for silent auction bid sheets. They are high quality and come in vibrant colors. My favorite (and seemingly most effective) is the Terra Green, followed by their Orange and Yellow colors. The neons just seem to pop and get people's attention. Plus, the green is incredibly unique; I have seldom seen anyone use anything close to it. I don't know what else I can say about paper other than this is wonderful and I'll continue to buy it (wherever it's least expensive, normally on Amazon).",1
"It works very well. But, as others Green Laser Pointers, it very strong, not to useful in a presentation inside a room.",0
"The pros: nice sharp blade, ergonomically-designed handle (you can cut for ages without getting a sore wrist), easy to store.Now. If only it would cut straight.This trimmer cuts on an angle - not sometimes, EVERY time. No matter how completely you line up the paper or card against the top edge, you will never (never ever ever) get a 90-degree trimmed edge.After a few hundred non-square corners and slanting edges it becomes deeply, deeply irritating. I'm back to buy something else... and not from Fiskars.",0
"I'm a Graphics person and extremely picky about how my photographs print out. I've tried Kodak, Epson, Generic brands, etc. etc. The absolute BEST photo paper in my opinion is Jet Print Photo paper Professional grade, but I have found this paper to be ALMOST as good and cheaper. So I buy this one now.",1
Very good pens. Plenty of ink and feel right in your hand. A bit pricey tho. But I like the 207s a lot.,1
"It is not possible to get the label software to run without crashing under Windows XP SP2; wasted several hours trying to make it work. Downloaded the updates from Casio's website but the application still would not start or would start and immediately crash. Had to install Windows 2000 under VMWare and finally I could get the software would run. However I was not able to print to the device (even though it had installed correctly).To make matters worse, even in manual mode the cartridge ink ribbon jammed on the first try. Tried a different cartridge and it also jammed. Returned it for another and exactly the same issue occurred. This product is terrible! I finally gave up and purchasedBrother PT-1950 Desktop 5-Line PC-Ready Labelerinstead.",0
The calculator is perfect. Just be careful when you buy it used that the seller indicates whether or not the owners manual comes with it. Mine did not. Thank goodness for the internet!,1
"I found this sturdy, attractive, and slim file box to be just what I was looking for. I bought it for work, where I often need to carry my files from room to room. Even when full, it doesn't feel heavy or bulky. After using the first box I ordered, I got another to use at home. This is an affordable and high-quality product.",1
"I bought these for my daughter, and she said they are the best she has ever used. They are much softer than the cheapies she has been using. Nice smooth color.",1
"This tape is excellent for its intended purpose. It is strong, and easy to handle from the roll (no splitting.) Works well, even on heavier packages. Also, it's clear enough to put over address labels to protect them from moisture without obscuring the writing. Solid product.",1

"I bought this same calculator from Amazon about two years ago and have used for appraising. I like the layout of the keys and the functionality - it's all you need for appraisal work. About two years of using it the display began to die, one digit at a time. Now I can no longer use it and have to buy another one. Not sure I want to considering the poor quality.",0
It works. It's just an old fashioned coin changer. Not sure what other info someone would really need.,1
"I wanted to give this calculator higher marks. On paper it appears to have alot going for it:o two line displayo editable equation historyo persistent function memories (4)o ""440"" functionso bitwise logical operators and five number baseso neat cheat sheeto equation solverHowever, the more I got to know this calculator the more I disliked it.1. The large glass panel covering the display (and the top 1/3rd of the unit) is highly reflective and makes the display hard to read under flourescents.2. The two line display is a source of continued frustration. The top line, which at first appears to be the input area, shares this function with the bottom line. Function key presses register immediately on the top line. The bottom line is for numeric input which only registers on the top line when a function key is pressed. Yuk! I often find myself having to delete redundant digits due to this input area confusion. Not so with the Casio Fx-115MS.3. The {algb} function suffers from [2]'s poor functional separation of input/output. Prompting for variable input is severely restricted--only the numeric input line is available--thus no expressions, only simple numeric literals. To populate the variables with expression results you must first evaluate and store these BEFORE executing the {algb} operation.4. The equation solver is also lame. No underlying algebraic rewrite rules are in effect as with the Casio Fx-115MS and HP 33s. So, if you want to perform a Time Value Money series, you will have to rewrite the equation yourself for each variable of interest (periodic payment, period interest rate, number of periods, principal, future balance).With its beaucoup functions I'm sure this calculator has alot to offer engineers. However, the function memory and equation history persistence don't quite compensate for its disturbing lack of elegance.",0
"If you need 2 lines stable cordless phone - this is it. Great Sound, Easy to use and long life battery.Plus - Great speakerphone in very good price. run and order one (or two) I also bought extra handset (TCX905)",1
"These are great for storing magazines or papers. I have a large number of reference magazines I keep, and these are good for that. However the holes in the sides of the file catch the corners of magazines when you insert the outside-most magazine, which is a bit annoying. If I was to buy again, I'd look for solid sided holders.",0
"I carry it in my lab coat pocket. It's tough, easy to use, and lightning fast. It impresses clients and makes me feel secure.",1
The manufacturers of this laptop accessory have forgotten to make a few holes in the foam. Now the heat from your computer can go nowhere other than the laptop stand. And as it is a type of plastic is starts to smell after using it for a longer time. So it is certainly not a a laptop cooler.Also i would have appreciated it when the bottom material would have been able to mould more around your legs. Now it is just something hard on top of your legs that is quite unstable. Finally i noticed that my computer tends to slide from time to time.So handy thing if you want to us it occasionally but not something for when oyu liek to work in the conservatory for a few hours.,0
"I was happy to find a phone with a mute button after my GE crapped out. This was a great phone for 2 to 3 weeks until the cord that attached the headphones starting to make a crackling noise. Also, the WiFi network card I used interferred with the phone everytime, rendering it useless while using my laptop.I so badly wanted this phone to work and work well. All other aspects were superb: large reception area, too many Caller Id stored numbers to count, great features and compact, PLUS a mute button for when one must do laundry on long conference calls from home.This phone is wonderful in theory, not so hot on actual function.",0
These are top quality stamps for all of your mailing needs. They are just like the ones used by the USPS. Shows your customers that you care about their merchandise. I highly recommend these.,1
"This is a decent looking phone, can hold a charge well, and is easy to use. The terrible range makes is un-usable for me. I can even walk into the next room with out getting terrible static. If I go more that 20 feet from the base, I lose my call. I think it's going back....",0
I was able to install the software without a problem. The phone communicates with my computer (time is updated and I can page the handset from the USB wireless thing) but I can not make a call nor are my Skype contacts transferred to the Lynksys handset. If I can't get the thing to work this weekend I will return the phone.,0
"If you read through the posts here you will find that the # 1 key on these handsets fail. You will also learn that many customers have contacted Panasonic by Phone, email, even regular mail to the Corporate office. Panasonic's response is the same, After the warranty, tough luck SUCKERS!. How can a company like this not stand behind a faulty product. I've replaced the handsets once already because of the # 1 key not working anymore and now the replacements, BRAND new handsets purchased just 12 months ago have also stopped dialing the # 1 key.Panasonic is aware of the problem, but they don't care, in fact they know that you spent enough money on the system to be able to milk you for the cost of the replacement handsets. It's good money for them. Way to Go Panasonic, way to screw average Joe Consumer. UNREAL. I'm never buying anything Panasonic again and I'm so mad right now that I'm going to make it my purpose in life to tell everyone how bad you guys suck with regards to customer satisfaction and standing behind your products.

"I bought this phone with answerer after a bit of research on the many different ones out there. I didn't want to spend a lot of money (there are the new 4.8 GHz phones out there) but I wanted a system that was expandable for rooms without a phone jack and a digital answerer. What I liked about the individual handsets was that each operated also as a speakerphone. It's great when you have a 18 month old who always wants to get on the phone when they see you talking, just press the speakerphone button, let them hold the phone and you can still hear and converse with the caller on the other end. The sound quality is pretty clear (having been on the opposite end of a speakerphone call) and the digital answerer is okay - could be better but I've definitely had worse. Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this phone and would recommend one to try it if they are looking for a similar system.",1
"This mouse pad is big, soft, and sturdy; perfect for everything I do on my computer. I am an avid gamer, and this pad is amazing for gaming. But I also use my computer a whole lot for school, doing extensive word processing, programming, and multimedia work. This pad is great for everything.I have a Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000, and it slides across this pad like butter. Very smooth. Also very quiet, even with dirty mouse feet. This pad also has a bunch of rubber-like grip material that was spattered on the bottom like paint, the result being that this pad does not move while your working on it.Since my mouse eliminates the need for any kind of wrist support, I wanted a pad that would be comfortable on my skin and wrist as I used my mouse. This pad delivers. It does have sharp edges, not rounded, but the top layer material is soft, so the edge doesn't bite; it's quite comfortable.I also love the fact that with 15 inches of lateral space to move my mouse, gone are the days of picking up my mouse and putting it back down again to be able to move my pointer all the way across my screen. This pad is quite large, so make sure you have room for it on your desk.The only downside, perhaps, is an aesthetic point: the graphic design on the surface. I personally don't have anything against it, but others might, and if there had been a choice of colors and/or designs to choose from, I probably would have chosen something else. Actually, I would prefer a solid color like black or blue or gray. I know designs help optical and laser mice track better, but this pad has enough texture on its surface to suffice. Even a slight cross-hatch pattern that doesn't really take away from a solid color, would have been nice.As it stands, I do think the design it comes with is pretty cool, but more importantly, the functionality of this pad is unsurpassed.",1
"Just got this little calculator and love it. It is dual powered (solar & battery), has a small footprint (3.25"" x 4.25""), big 8 digit display, easy to use keys, and a tilt top. I recommend this product and may buy another one.",1
"I purchased this machine because it has the most recording time and most mailboxes of all the consumer systems out there--I need these features for my business. I also need the recording quality to be good, like your run-of-the-mill commercial voicemail system (or the old cassette-type machines) because I need to capture and edit these voice messages on my computer. On the recommendation of a couple of reviewers in this forum who stated that the voice quality was great, I decided to give this model a try.Well, this system does deliver the capacity, but I'm sorry to say that the voice quality is one of the worst I've ever heard on a digital answering machine. It's the same problem that plagues all digital answerers: it sounds like you're hearing the message through water. I have a puny, 4-year-old digital Radio Shack answerer at home that blows this item away in terms of voice quality. (Unfortunately Radio Shack no longer makes answerers.) In terms of the outgoing message, I tried recording it remotely by calling in (which results in a much better sounding announcement than doing it in the same room), but even that sounds crummy.Sorry to be a downer here. Don't get me wrong: this unit may suit you for home purposes, but the quality--which I find to be at or slightly below par for digital answerers--is not at all acceptable for a business.I am really disappointed with the state of affairs in the digital answering machine world (and regular telephones for that matter, but that's a whole other story). Tape-based machines, which have far superior fidelity compared to these digital pieces of junk, are no longer made. I am truly perplexed why we can't get the quality of commercial voicemail servers in a small package. Are the makers of commercial servers are in cahoots with the folks who make consumer models to keep the quality down?So, the bottom line is that I thought I could get away with not paying my local phone company $10/month for voicemail service, but alas, I have finally decided I cannot. Just what this world needs--someone giving more easy money to AT&T; for voicemail service.",0
"This stuff is incredible. Here's how it works.Shake the bottle, remove the cap, press the tip against a surface, squeeze the tube and some goo comes out. It's about the consistency of Elmer's glue. It's conductive. It dries in about 5-10 minutes. It's a modest glue with silver particles mixed in it. If I want additional strength, I'll use a toothpick or straight pin to add some Shoe Goo (silicone, slightly flexible) or a little dab of hot-melt glue once everything is electrically secure.To create a trace as thin as you like, cover the surrounding area with two strips of scotch tape so there's a thin gap between them. Squeeze a small dot on a piece of scrap paper, pick up a bit with a toothpick or straight pin, and paint the work area or just apply directly to the work from the tube. When it's dry, just peel off the tape and you'll have an absurdly thin, perfect, conductive trace.As an experiment, I once created a circuit that fit entirely on the top of a 9-volt battery snap -- that's a pretty small area for a handbuilt circuit. It consisted of two 16-pin integrated circuits (LM556 timers), 8 surface-mount capacitors, 4 surface-mount resistors, 4 LED's (that flashed sequentially when triggered), wire connections, ground and power buss lines, and a piece of wire used as a switch. The twin buss lines were laid on top of the IC's, and the capacitors, resistors and wires were all connected directly to the IC's legs. Altogether there were 36 connections made with this stuff. It was actually pretty easy to do.This level of construction is impossible without Circuit Writer.It's also perfect for electromagnetic sealing of mating surfaces used in radio-frequency circuits. Quick patch jobs are easier than heating up a solder pencil, and there's no heat. I can attach a hair-thin wire to a spot on a PC board that's so tiny I need a magnifying glass just to see it (just did that, in fact).A buddy dropped his (very expensive) studio-quality recorder, it landed on the power cord, and that snapped off a chunk of the PC board inside. Repairing it was impossible. I used tiny strands of bare wire, laid them on the traces to mate all of the (very thin) broken PC traces and just ""glued"" them down. A little epoxy to stabilize the board pieces and it was all set. I told him to be more careful in the future. A conventional repair facility would have simply ordered a new PC board and charged him more than the device was worth, so it simply would have been discarded.I am just delighted that this tool is finally available at Amazon. For many years, finding it was sketchy.Once opened, it's supposed to remain useable for 12 months. Unopened, it's supposed to be good for 24 months.",1

"To comment on A.J.Bracuti's complaints:1. This phone operates like a cell phone. You don't have to scroll through the whole ""phone book"" contact list; just key the first letter of the contact name and it jumps to that alphabetical position, then you may have to scroll from there. But you can minimize that by prefix letters; eg all my take-out restaurants have RST&lt;space> as the first four letters. I like it better than the 9-entry scheme. With appropriate letter prefixes you could emulate a 9-entry list.2. I too was disappointed that there apparently isn't even a non-standard wall plate with the required mounting-lug spacing available, and in the installation instructions there is no specific mating wall plate identified. (The ATT wall phone this replaces did have two optional spacings: one the standard and the other the same as this GE phone.) There is a simple solution though: Use the upper lug as-is and, instead of using the lower lug, replace the lower screw holding the plate to the box frame with a slightly longer screw with a slightly larger pan head; it's at just the right spacing; if you let it stand out ~1/4"", you can clip the phone on and it's snug & securely mounted.As others have commented, it is plastic & not stainless steel (which would have been really cool). The range, clarity & telephone functions are all fine. The only thing I would change is the handset loudness; I can just barely adjust it as loud as I need it. Given that there are so few true wall-mount phones available, I would buy it again. (Most so-called wall phones, like Panasonic, have adapters that are really just shelves that stick out too far.)",0

"This is just what I needed for what I'm using it for.I have a cockatiel (small parrot) that has physical problems and has trouble perching like a normal bird for long periods. He likes to spend part of his day settled on top of his plastic feeders, which then get messy and can be difficult to clean. I was looking for a way to anchor paper towel ""diapers"" on top so they'd stay put but be easy to remove when I wanted to change them. This does the job perfectly. It stays on the plastic and holds the towels in place, yet the towels are easy to remove. The tape strips last all week and then come off the plastic easily when I'm ready to clean the feeders.My only quibble is that the backing is a little hard to get hold of, which makes it a bit annoying to peel off.",0

"I had this phone for just over a year. I liked the features such as the LCD screen to display a directory and built in answering machine, but the problems are bad. Besides off and on problems, like not always getting a dialtone when the phone is removed from the base, I started to encounter bad static problems. These would occur if I was only standing 2 feet away from the base. The person on the other end could not ever hear the static so it is a transmittal problem between the base and handset. It is even worse if any appliances are working, especially the microwave. I purchased a 2.4GHz because I thought that a different transmittal range would give great clarity. Well, I now have a phone that is 2 months out of warranty and is unuseable. Stick with a quality 900 MHz phone at a fraction of the price and you will be much happier.

"Our old Royal used paper tape and thus could produce a roll containing a complete record of the day's transactions plus, if you used duplicate paper tape, a copy of each sale for the customer. After over 10 years of service, it finally blew up, and we replaced it with this one because it looked identical and we figured it would be a seamless transition.But this stupid machine only uses thermal paper. Thermal paper doesn't come in duplicate rolls. So, you can print a journal for yourself OR you can feed the tape out so your customers can each have a record of their transaction, but NOT both. WTH???? If your customer asks for their receipt, get this: you have to hit a particular keystroke to get the machine to print a duplicate receipt, and then you have to open the journal cover (which doesn't fit well), use a pair of scissors to cut the customer's receipt out of the roll, and then tape the two ends of your journal tape back together! It's the hokiest, most atrocious, ridiculous arrangement ever. What century are these people living in?If the paper spool runs out the machine locks up almost completely until you get another roll in it - forget about trying to complete the sale and getting the customer served quickly. If you happen to not have another roll at all, God help you, you're done, lock the doors.Worse, this machine is in the habit of freezing up and being rendered useless for reasons no one knows. The manual offers no effective solution except to do a FULL SYSTEM CLEAR and lose all your programming and all your transaction data!You can call Royal at a toll-free number for assistance, but you're up the river without a paddle if the problem happens in the evening or on a weekend.There's a 9-pin connection that allows you to add some sort of device to the system... but shockingly, inexcusably, no data card port so that you can back up your transaction data.It's shockingly bad design.Finally, the manual is next to useless - it contains information such as keystroke commands that don't work, and the keywords for the problem you're having probably aren't in the index.No-brainer conclusion: stay far, far away from this machine.",0

I would give it ZERO stars if possible. Horrible interference. A constant annoying hum is heard. However it is comfortable to hold against your head if thats a plus.,0
"Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features. Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again. Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit! I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk! The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive. Save your money and save the headaches! Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster!",0
"If you have a home office, or office in your home, this phone is perfect for you. You can listen to voice mail from the speaker phone on the base unit or handset! Talking called ID lets you hear who is calling, without having to see the handset! Great range and a clear signal! Great value!",1
"The picture depicts wide (7 mm wide x 37 mm long) erasers that almost fill the width of the tube. This is actually a picture of PaperMate item 64892. What you get if you order this product is item 64891 (about 4 mm wide x 14 mm long, with a metal retaining clip), which is NOT INTERCHANGEABLE with 64892.",0
bought 2 of these pads have been using them for a couple of weeks and for the price can't go wrong,1
I was not very pleased with the phone it seem to be very cheap plastic did not secure to the wall very well and the design of the receiver is just well stupid. You can not hold the phone against your shoulder and talk without hands because the receiver is to narrow. I'm looking for a replacement phone already.,0
Didn't last very long for my use and was frustrating to use compared to my Sharp desktop one I had for years. I recommend getting the best one you can afford and stop filling the dumps up with junk like this...,0
"After having my initial phone about 6 months, it died. Sent in to panasonic, took them TWO months to fix and send back! (it totally quit working, power supply was still good though) Then after 1 year and 1 month after original purchase, died again (this time it had an error msg indicated on the LED readout on the base, and nothing worked).They said even though they had the phone two months for fixing the first time it died, it didn't extend the warranty at all! But they did go ahead and fix it at no charge. Since then, I have had the out of range problem, even when only 5 feet from the base unit. It just gets worse over time. And this is the the 3rd one I'm on.The sound quality has progressively gotten worse, along withthe out of range problem. Caller ID doesn't always show upeither.I've also had an ongoing problem where sometimes after removing it from the base unit, it doesn't recognize it. So I have tore-insert it a few times before it recognizes.There is one GREAT feature I love about the phone, its theanswering machine, because it can be programmed to page you(I have a Skytel alpha pager) when you receive a call, and willsend the number displayed on caller ID, and also indicate whetherthe person left a message or not.I wrote a complaint letter to Panasonic after the phone dieda second time and they weren't going to fix it. It really bothered me that they didn't extend the original warranty bytwo months, when it took them two months to return it to methe first time. They never responded to the complaint.",0

"I bought this for my Granddaughter's second birthday. The minute she saw it she was moving the chairs around (perfect size). After she had placed the chairs where she wanted them, she went and got two of her bears and one of her dollies which she promptly placed in the chairs around the table. Then she went and got her tea pot and various tea cups and set those around the table. She finished by pouring everyone a cup of tea and then herself and started a conversation. She did this without any prompting from anyone and this was her first experience with a table and chairs of her own size. She eats most of her meals on it and it has been a wonderful table for her art projects. We all simply love it.",1

"I have had my VoIP service for a week now. I got Vonage as a replacement for my normal broadband service. I pay less now for a month of unlimited service with Vonage, than I did just to have a line with caller-id at my old provider. That's saying something. Anyway, my issue with this product, and the reason is receives 2 stars from me is because the Phone Adapter is LOCKED to the Vonage service.""Setup is simple: Just connect one end of the included Vonage-certified Linksys PAP2 phone adapter to your Ethernet router or gateway and the other end to your telephone. Then sign up for Vonage phone service."" This is how Amazon describes it. A nice little endorsement for the tie-in product. The ""Vonage-certified"" wording makes it seem as if this device is a phone adaptor that work with other VoIP providers but is guaranteed to work on the Vonage network. A better choice of words would be Vonage-locked, or Vonage-only so that you know exactly what you're getting. I feel like I've been tricked into buy this product. Nowhere on the packaging did I see that this was a Vonage only device. Why did I spend $50+s/h to buy this device when I can get a device directly from Vonage for less? At least if I got the adapter straight from Vonage I would get my money back when I returned it if I chose to cancel my service.I thought I was buying a phone adapter that I could port to other services (Voicepulse, SunRocket, Lingo, Packet8 etc.) but instead I got an overpriced, locked piece of hardware that Vonage, itself, basically gives away for free. If you want a Phone Adapter that you can use with other services check out the Sipura 2000. The PAP2 and Sipura 2000 are identical internally(the PAP2 looks much cooler though), but the Sipura is not locked to a service. I'm returning my PAP2 as soon as my Sipura 2k comes in.",0
"I have a very old Swingline 13 Stapler (it is all metal). It worked fine but I ran out of Staples. I then purchased these Staples and , of course, the stapler jams up with the first staple. I then went to Staples and purchased a Swingline Heavy Duty Stapler 30095. I get that back to the office and that stapler jammed up. Then my classic Swingline stapler jammed up so I went back to Staples and got a Swingline Optima Jam Free Guaranteed stapler and of course, first staple out it jams up. I took the Optima back and just purchased the plain old Classic Swingline which also jammed up but I finally got it working. It appears that Swingline which is Acco Brands, Inc. (and all there staplers are made in China) is just peddling junk to everyone but they are also the biggest stapler/staple manufacturer. Ugh!",0
"I'm an admitted office supply nerd. I too read about this stapler in Business 2.0 and decided to buy one. It works great! At first you end up pressing harder than you need to but eventually get used to using very little force.The only minor drawback is the ~20 page limitation, but then again, try stapling 20+ pages with a regular stapler. The cool part is the distinctive 'pop' sound when you staple. I understand there is a 3 hole punch to coming out too.I would buy this item again, in fact I bought one for my wife at home!",1

"OK, nowhere on the description of this product does it say ""PS/2"", but it is. Don't be like me and assume that since this is the 21st century that PS/2 items no longer sell. I was pretty hacked off when I opened the box and the packing slip said ""PS/2"" and the cable reflected the same. GRRRRRRRRRR! Don't know who's fault this is, but they should be repremanded.",0

Thank you to everyone who helped seal the fact that this phone is dead after the E3 error. Funny thing is that I've had the error a few times in the past 6 mos and I've gotten it to reset every time. This time was the end though... a power outage and now its dead. :-(,0
"I forgot to see the review before I bought this item. I thought it's cheap, so I didn't hesitate .After I got this pad, the smell is too strong that cause me sneeze a lot. Then I read the review here, many people have the same situation .wasting me 2 dollars.",0
"Great product. Brand new, never used. Sony telephones are hard to find now a days. This one is good, but it has a couple of negatives. 1. The caller ID on the base is always on (not a big deal until you turn off all the lights and are trying to sleep...then the whole room get's a HULK sort of glow going on)and 2. the battery will not hold a charge so using the hand set is a no go. It is an older telephone, so IM sure it just needs a new battery. BUT, there is a problem with that as well. You just cannot go to your local Walmart and find replacement batteries for these telephones anymore. IM sure BESTBUY or RADIOSHACK have them. Just haven't had time to look. SONY North America's web site will also be of help. All in all a great phone. Awsome seller!",0
"I've been a cordless phone fan since the days of sub-50 mhz frequencies, and I've been using 2.4 Ghz phones around the house now for more than 2 years. They were really only a bit clearer than the 900 mhz phones they replaced, and their range was about the same. However, this high frequency seems to find itself isolated enough from household interference (lights, cell phones, etc.) to achieve real quiet! I would say the quality of the connection is almost identical to that of a corded phone.The 5830 setup was simple: Plug it in to the phone line and power plug (the fairly small transformer is nice too), enter the base ID # from the sticker under the phone, and you're ready to use the phone.The menus are just okay; they may be a bit less than perfect but they're usable without instructions. Anyway, from the menu, you may (but do not have to) select ring style, ring volume, vibrate or no, and enter the time digitally.I've added 2 extensions (5800) and these are set up just as the base is, but the number you register on each handset is that of the base unit. Range and intercom on the handsets are great, and the voice quality again is comparable to corded phones.In both cases, the called ID display is very nicely done. It is lit in a very attractive and functional blue with a large enough display to read both the name and number without (my) glasses.Lastly, the message waiting light (I use the phone company's voice mail svc) is easy to see from across the room, it too a cool neon blue that illuminates an &quot;O&quot; around the ear piece. The effect is quite techno-hip, as well as being highly functional.In short, the 5800 series is a very nice execution of a very good new technology.",1
"Their products are full of glitches. This bedroom phone stopped displaying the Caller ID correctly the first time I bought it. After I brought it back to the store for a replacement, the time was always wrong. It would show the right time when a call came in, but would get stuck there until the next call. Look for similar statements about other GE phones and take the advice not to buy a GE phone.",0
"Range is HORRIBLE, and that's being nice.I have a 3 story house and I lose reception one level away. Waste of money, very poorly constructed.",0
"I waited until Christmas to use these gold foil labels and they were great. The size is substantial and can be seen, not like my other mini ones. The print stayed on the label with no smearing and the print was able to be seen and not faded looking against the color of the label. Have a retirement party coming up and can't wait to use these for the invitations.",1
"I bought this unit and another similar phone (both from Clarity) for my mom. Both broke down within 6 months. There is no amplied effect now (the sound is actually weaker than a normal phone now). The ""push down"" bottons which is supposed to amplify sound also no longer work. I bought two other brands at the same time which are still working.",0
"I send a lot of packages and I have used Scotch brand tape for probably 20 years. This super strength tape really is thicker and stronger than the regular Scotch brand. It's excellent for sealing and closing boxes. Because it's thicker, I did notice some ""gapping"" when using the tape to affix labels or to close box flaps that aren't completely flat. For example, if you have a box flap which is slightly indented, the thickness of this tape can make it difficult to conform to the flap's surface. That's my only complaint. This tape is so strong I have set it aside to use for moving boxes, and I plan to buy more of it when we pack everything up.",1

"I used to own an older remote and I bought this one because of its many features. I returned to my old unit. This remote is extremely unreliable. When you plug it into the USB, it takes a while for the remote to activate; it stops working at random; some features are very difficult to program; it is extremely unreliable for class presentations. Sorry to give this negative review, in spite of the fact that its features look promising.",0
"I've had this shredder in my office for a little over 2 years and it's way overdue for a replacement. There is a gap inbetween the collection bin and the holder it is in, so shreddings collect behind the bin until it pushes the bin out. Jamming is a problem and we don't feel comfortable feeding more than 3-4 sheets in at a time. When we first purchased this unit (a very long time ago), it was approved for CDs, now it apparently is not. Also this machine has starting making this loud grinding noise that almost hurts my ears when shredding papers.We are purchasing the C-420C and hope that it will be a better preformer. I guess you get what you pay for!",0
"Battery life...what battery life?! This should be a great phone. It has a spare modern design - in sharp contrast to most of the current phones, which seem to be aimed at a 13-15 year old demographic -, excellent transmission clarity, power outage backup, etc. One small problem though. The phone dies after only a minute or two of talk time. I've switched batteries, purchased new batteries...nothing works. Don't buy this phone unless you want to use it as a bit of post-modern electronica art.",0
Phones came in original boxes as purchased. Setup was easy. They work great. Distance from base and clarity are very good.,1
"Its is a very good product BUT I beleve it cost too much ""for"" a add on phone",0
I've ordered nine of these so far and have received three of them broken. I don't know why since the they're carefully packaged. Maybe they were broken before they were packaged? I was able to glue them and with the cards in them you can't see the break.,0
This would be the perfect phone if you didn't have to deal with the horrible echo that can occur while talking on the handset.I can't believe Siemens would release a phone with such an obvious problem.,0
"I live with 4 roommates and we installed this right by the door for sorting mail, storing chore lists and other communal stuff. It is very convienent and easy to install. My only complaint is that it is not black like in the picture. When they say ""clear"" in the description they mean completely colorless, see-right-through it clear, not black tinted translucent as I expected. But still, it does the job and is very reasonably priced.",1
These Bic pens are a great value for the price. They are difficult for kids to take apart - a real PLUS!,1
"It is cheap, which is the only thing going for it. Aside from the usual complaints about it not being an HP (no RPN? terrible keys? fashionable looking?), it had a short unhappy life before it started crashing. Crashing when turned on. Crashing when picked up. Crashing when doing multiplications. I gave mine away and the person who got it had nothing but complaints.",0
"We have three of these units and the battery lasts for no longer than ten minutes (!) of talk time unless you buy expensive new batteries every two or three months. Also, after about a year of owning these units, the LCD screens became almost completely illegible on all three handsets. These must have been the cheapest LCD screens Motorola could get their hands on.",0
"Great value and easy to use. Only draw back is the caller ID is difficult to read, other than that it's exactly what I expected.",1
This is an impressive product. It's bigger than you'd image and has a sleek design... what seems like enamel paint is incredibly nick and scratch resistant. The box itself is anything but tinny... you could easily stand and jump up and down on box. Only weak aspect is the lock--given the weight and size of the box you'd think lock would be a bit larger.,1
I returned this item because the blade was dull and would not cut even one sheet of paper evenly. The first few inches of cut was acceptable then the paper just tore. I was very disappointed.,0
"I was excited when this phone became available. I just bought an old house and hoped I wouldn't have to hardwire new jacks all over the house. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The range is worse than my cheap 900Mhz phone, it doesn't even reach all the rooms in my house, let alone the backyard. The voice quality is poor as well. It sounds OK from my end, most of the time, but the people on the other end frequently complain that it sounds like I am under water.",0
My order through Amazon for the Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencils was received in just a couple days. They make ordering online so easy. The pencils were first rate.,1
"I've just received this product. I was tempted to buy it from the photos and when I received it I found that it's a cheap looking design and not very light weight.Additionally, it was not well packaged and it has arrived defective (probably from transportation). But unfortunately there's nothing I can do about it because I'm outside the states and returning it will cost much more than the item price.In short, I'm sure there are better alternatives.",0
"I absolutely love this stand. I was initially thinking about going with the Griffin stand, but I decided to be a little wild and swing for this one instead. I was NOT disappointed. It's rock solid and it is pretty much perfect in every way.I have it holding my Black Macbook but it would probably look even more awesome with a Macbook Pro on it. It holds either machine at the perfect height.",1
"A few points:1) too small - too large...it is irrelevant since you can adjust the sensitivity on a mouse to compensate for mousepad size.2) the gel rest is in fact very comfortable and the surface is very rugged. I had one for 3 years and the only major difference was a slight color variance on the gel rest surface after years of contact with skin oils. Yes...it is easily puncturable by children with scissors, as a former reviewer mentioned...but so are bicycle tires, eyeballs and kittens...thus why supervision may be necessary on the common sense level.3) The mousing surface requires wiping down every once in a while. After 4 years it looked practically brand new with regular (once a week) cleaning.4) I talked to Fellowes a while back when I bought my first one of these models. The 5th star was lost because this model does seem to have a problem with a bad chemical smell when I first purchased it - I was worried that the chemicals in the gel were actually seeping through the gel rest casing and onto my skin. Upon speaking to someone at the company I was told that it is not the chemicals that is making the smell...it is that fact that some people's skin oils just have that reaction with the plastic gel casing. It doesn't happen to everyone, but it does happen to an unlucky few who have the right body chemistry. They told me the smell would cease in 2-3 weeks of use....and it did completely.All in all this model does what it was meant to do - it's not going to win any academy awards, but on the flip side it's not the devil either. I own a logitech optical mouse and everything works fine with me on each of the 3 I have purchased. It is a very pleasant blue, the rest is rather comfortable and the plastic gel casing is a nice change from the fabric covering that most other mousepads w/rests use. If they learned to make a gel casing that wouldn't react to some skin chemistries...this would get a 5 star rating from me. (at the very least the chemical smell should be mentioned on the packaging and brief explanation given)",0
"These folders are Awesome with a capital A. This is a very high quality product. They can be used for a lot of different things. The colors was nice.

As expected when you order something from amazon, they come really fast.",1

"Replacing my Uniden cordless set after callers complained about the sound quality, I chose this Panasonic set, and I am pleased. The sound quality is great, and I especially like the various ring tones that are available. I have different phone sets programmed to ring at various volumes, depending on the room they are located in, and that works well.If you are looking for a replacement set, this one is great. It only comes with 3 handsets, my Uniden had 4 but I really don't miss the 4th one.",1
"This product is not very well thought out. The battery lasts less then 24 hours not on the charger. Its range is about 30 feet in doors. It requires you to dial ""+"" ""country code"" ""city code"" ""number"" for every number. The sound quality is terrible.It would be forgivable if the product was priced below $20. But its retailing as much as $100 and so its not forgivable.",0
"Perfect sound quality, feels like a quality product...until it died on me inexplicably--had it for 18 months.",0
"I haven't found one pen that will let me write more than a few letters before it runs out of ink. My homework looks like a ""Wheel of Fortune"" puzzle. I've tried 8 different pens, and I've tried varying the pressure on the pen and the types of paper. No luck. These are going back. I used to trust Uniball's reputation, but these are terrible.",0
Integrated into my phone system perfectly. Very easy to follow instructions. Works like a charm. I've had it for a month now and am very happy with the product. Panasonic phone systems are very high quality.,1
"I preordered this phone. Very ""plasticky"" cheap feel to it. Although sound is OK, I find it has more functional problems. It has backlight for numbers but they forgot to make the numbers in the keys transparent so you can see there is light BEHIND the keys but it does not come through them so you can't see them in the dark. If you want to skypeout and dial +1 and the number but make a mistake and press the green phone key you are dialing through your land line. Ok, so you bring up the call list and then press the Options key to dial via skypeout and you can't. You have to input the whole number again and press Option and then select SkypeOut. The call list only works well for landline calls. The phone does not ""remember"" if the call was through skypeout and allow you to repeat it later; it will dial it via the landline. Also, tones will not work with some PBXs with skypeout. Putting a call on wait and taking another incomming call doesn't work very well. This is a pretty expensive phone to have all these problems. I am sorry I bought it.",0
"This is the 2nd Vtech Polyphonic ring tone phone that I have lost. The first had changeable face plates. This one might be aesthetically pleasing, but became DOA after a year of use.

"As several reviewers have noted, this unit notoriously reports ""low battery"" after just a few uses. This is the case even when using very new ""digital"" batteries.I'm rating this with two stars instead of one because I find the interface is easy to use and functional. If not for the power problem, this would unit would be fine.I would have liked to see an optional AC adapter for this, and would have gladly paid for it. As it is, I'm keeping my eye out for a new labeler.",0
"I thought this sorter was absolutely horrible. I ordered it for my classroom, and first it took 2 weeks after the scheduled delivery date to get to me. Then when it came, it was all cardboard. It was deceiving because the picture made it look so nice. However, it was a pain to put together, and took two people to put it together. Plus, while I was putting it together, some of the cardboard bent. Overall, it was a disappointing purchase, because of the description and the picture. I would not buy this again in the future.",0
"Plugged it into Vista and it worked right away. My wife took it to school as a gift for the teacher and plugged it into a Mac. It didn't work. She called Tech Support and they advised that she reboot the machine. She did and then it worked. I'd never by a Mac, but the smart pointer is awesome.",1
"I had been looking everywhere for these folders. None of the office stores or office sections of other large shopping stores had them. One day as I was using one that I had in my files for a very long time, I saw some information on the edge of the file. With the help of a magnifying glass, I was able to find enough information to do a search online for them. Happily, I found a supplier and now I have 50 in my office! They are THE best, sturdiest, finest folders I have used. Thanks for having them available. For anyone who hasn't tried these.....do order some! You won't be disappointed!",1
I have brought this phone a month ago and installed it as soon as I opened the box. I was very disappointed with this phone. The dial tone was too weak I can barely hear it. When I made the phone call it was hard for me to hear the other end. I needed to buy another one.,0
"This is an excellent pen. It is very comfortable to hold, writes smoothly, and looks nice too! With other pens I would often get hand cramps, but not with this pen. I highly recommend this pen to anyone who has to write a lot!",1
I bought this phone based on the reviews here and its ability to not interfere with Wifi. The features are great:voicemail alerts and voicemail dialingvarious ringersphonebookcaller id enhanced (see caller id of person even in call waiting mode)speaker phone (a big plus in my book)No Wifi Interference.BUT the biggest problem was the quality of voice. Quality of voice coming in is fine but everyone else heard an echo (like I was in a tunnel) when I called them. Annoyed people enough that I am returning this just after owning it a few days.I replaced it with a Uniden Tru Series and that has been much better. Uniden's sound isn't perfect but its MUCH improved than this Panasonic. The Uniden Series is recommended by TomsNetworking (any networking geek should know this guide and review site) The only feature Uniden really lacks is the multi colored alerts otherwise it matches the panasonic feature for feature,0
"We had this phone for a year and used it a LOT. At first it had great distance and clarity, but it soon got worse and worse and the battery life got shorter and shorter. We both work from home and need a clear line, so had to buy a different phone to keep working. For what we paid for this phone, we expected a lot better durability. Also, I agree with the other reviews that complain about the number of &quot;keystrokes&quot; you have to go through to redial or dial a number in memory. Very cumbersome. I believe there are much better models out there for less money.",0
I've had this shredder for approximately a month. I haven't experienced any problems...as a matter of fact...I'm looking for things to shred. I wanted to test if this shredder handles CDs...no problem. I'm happy with my purchase.,1

"I used the 35 when it first came out. Then, the 45. The first HP i purchased was the 25, then the 41cv, 32sII, 48gx, 33s, and now the 35s. I teach preparation classes for the FE and PE exam. I have, probably, the most insignificant of comments on this whole board. The yellow shift key has an arrow that points to the left and the blue shift key an arrow that points to the right. This is a carryover from the calculators that have one colour on one side of the button and the other colour on the other side. But the 35s has the yellow on top and the blue on the bottom. There is no need for the directional arrows. What's worse, the Blue (shift key arrow to the right) functions exist on the left side of the keys! So the shift button points to the right but the command is found on the left. Arrrrgh! Hopefully, HP will stay on this track and start producing the type of calculators that we have come to know and love from this company.",0
"Bic Velocity Retractable Ballpoint Pen is a very good writing device from a company that many consider the foremost name in writing utensils. Bic offers many different ballpoint pens, but Bic Velocity Ballpoint Pen is better than most others in its class for several reasons; most notably its more attractive design, improved comfort, retractable tip, and its medium point that makes a distinct line of ink.Less expensive ballpoint pens can cause discomfort when used for an extended period of time and the main reason is the thinness of the design and lack of any gripping surface. Bic Velocity Retractable Ballpoint Pen solves both of these problems with its slightly wider body and enhanced rubber gripping surface. Placed near the writing tip, the gripping surface keeps the pen from slipping and also provides for a slightly wider grip, for better comfort. I don't notice any strain when I use this Bic pen, even for an extended period of time. The less expensive pens are usually very thin, and I can feel fatigue in my wrist or fingers after extended use.My overall preference with pens is to use gel pens, but gel pens are not practical for every type of writing assignment. Ballpoint pens like Bic Velocity Retractable are nice when you want the ink in your pen to last and you want to avoid any chance of smearing. Depending on usage, the ink in the Bic Velocity Retractable Ballpoint Pen will last for a very long time. Also, you can easily replace the ink container if you like. The price of these pens is very low; so many people might just throw them away when the ink runs dry. But it is nice to know that replacement is an option, if that is the route you choose to take.Many people don't think twice when they select a pen because they figure one is the same as another. But there really is a difference among pens and the Bic Velocity Retractable Ballpoint Pen is a very good pen with smooth flowing ink that doesn't skip, dries quickly, and doesn't smear. The attractive design, lack of any cap to lose, and improved comfort make Bic Velocity Ballpoint pen a better writing device and one that I recommend to all.",1
"I would give this five stars but the first one I received was torn at the bottom of the front cover joint to the spine. I need an oversize binder so I can put paper recipes in plastic sleeves. I use the sleeves that hold the entire paper without punching holes in it. These plastic pockets are wider than the others so I then have to use oversized dividers which require an oversize binder - whew! I like the construction and the interior pockets. If it holds up, it will be perfect!",1
"unacceptable line static...sounds like a record player. I've tried moving the base and remotes all over the house and there is no difference.The speakerphone is also weak. Compared to my old model Uniden Power Max, this one doesn't cut it. The old model had no static whatsover and was a 5.8 ghz also.",0

Man Kanye West proved to the critics that his sophomore album would not be a slump and it almost beats his debut. I like every song on here except for the very last track but the rest over power that easily. To the haters that are saying that he is way overrated f**k you I mean why are saying that maybe because you are a Tony Yahoe fan and mad because this album had over a hundred reviews on the first day of release and is already platinum and the gay unit fans are pissed because one member is not getting attention. Oh well do not listen to them this album is well worth the money and better then all the rap album that have been released this year so hurry and buy this.,0
"These envelopes have proved to be the best that I could find for keeping track of expense receipts.I would recommend them, even though I have to put labels over the columns in order to use them for my receipt organizing purposes. Since I have to use labels, I gave them a 4-star rating.",1

This product could not be loaded on my computer because it did not recognize the product key that was shipped with the software. I contacted TI-Cares which is an oxymoron. Talked to a non-caring service technician. Told to email the license agreement to TI. Never heard from TI. The only positive was the Amazon return response. It went smoothly and fairly quickly. No longer a TI fan. This was my first return experience with Amazon. They have their act together. This was new software.,0
"Only time can tell if the rings will hold up to their claim of durability. The binder itself seems well made. I like that dividers won't stick out but keep this in mind as the binder will be longer on a bookself and not lie smooth with other binders. This feature also makes it a little larger to carry - larger to fit in a backpack etc. For my use, it will be for storage of documents so this is not an issue. Overall, it is just what I needed.",1
"Keep these at all doors, especially autoclosers. This is really an awesome product that releaves your need for extra hands at doorways.",1
I'm very happy with this furniture collection. Sturdy and does not look cheap. Assembly is quite easy...just follow the instructions. Chair is great. Desk is bigger than it seems in the picture and foyer table is smaller than it seems in the picture. File cabinet is fine except for a gap between top and bottom drawers...no wood there. I guess the gap is due to pre-installed glides on side panels and drawers...not my assembly.,1
"The phone does look cool-better than the previous models. The battery life on the handset is pathetic. All night charge may get you 10 minutes of talk-time, if you're lucky. Defeats the purpose of buying a cordless phone altogether. Caller ID does not work properly, most of the times.",0
"Excellent for controlling that messy DVD collection (just be sure to keep a master list or database of DVD location!). The boxes snap together in seconds. They seem flimsy but once filled are firm enough to stack 2 or 3 high; I wouldn't try for higher. These are the cheapest solution for DVD storage that looks well, but since inexpensive, they are rather fragile. Despite some ads that refer to 'leather' these are made of library paper over cardboard - so don't get them wet, and don't drag them over each other or the paper will fray. Caution: We ordered lots of them and several sets were badly damaged - frayed or crushed corners. AMAZON* was very quick to replace them. Still, since they are not carefully packed I would buy future ones locally where I could examine them first. *: The replacements were very well packed.",0
"I love this handset... goes with my Panasonic phone system KX-TG2382B. The handsets with this system are larger than the newer ones, easier to use and read, and the system itself along with the original 2 handsets has lasted me for well over ten years now. I ordered this third handset because I needed another phone in my garage and it's working out perfectly!And the company I ordered it from is called Savingspree. They are the best! If you need any help with anything, Timothy is right there with the answers. Great product, GREAT customer service!!!Thank you Amazon, and thank you Timothy/Savingspree!",1

"I've recently begun using fountain pens and started with one of the pilot disposable pens and was quite happy, with the exception of the ink running a bit. I got this pen as a Christmas gift but have not been entirely satisfied. I now have the opposite problem I had with the pilot pen. If I attempt to strike a line, even at slower speeds, I usually do not end up with a continuous line. I thought perhaps it was just the ink cartridge, so I got a converter and filled it with Noodler's polar black (after flushing the pen with an ammonia/water mixture), but I'm still having the same issue with not being able to strike a seamless line. Perhaps this is just common of the fine nibs, but it's been rather frustrating.",0
Cheaply made and for the price just not worth it. I needed a filing cabinet bad and I went online to save money and to buy something aesthetically acceptable not just whatever they had on the shelf at the store. This product was either so poorly made or poorly packaged it arrived with broken pieces. Amazon was GREAT about taking it back and I have a box en route to me now for return shipment.BUT for $105.00 i expect metal not plastic parts and to be honest I would have proffered it came mostly assembled and not in a million pieces (I AM mechanically inclined but I was paying for the privilege not to have to deal with it). I could have bought the same thing at IKEA for 1/3rd the price if I wanted to put it together.,0
"This pad has a blue light that glows around the edge when powered by USB, which makes it look awesome with my Saitek Lighted Keyboard and Razer Diamondback Plasma mouse which are both in blue. Easy to locate everything even in low light! Very slick surface, and with the Razer I had to turn the settings down to keep from overshooting my intended area- I'm not a major gamer, so I'm not using the full capabilities of the setup I'm sure. This pad is a bit large, so make sure you have the room- I use mine lengthwise rather than side to side. Super fast pad without a super fast price!",1
"I bought this cart to use at work, carrying books and files from one office to another (different buildings, quite a distance). Mine has been through rough turf outdoors and has held up beautifully. It's easy to maneuver on pavement, rugs and regular floors.

"I have been doing project management for years and can't imagine functioning without these file folders.The old manila folders we are used to seeing are great for filing. These are not for filing, but for USE of your files. When I have manila folders on my desk, I can't see what's inside and I'm always fishing around to see what's on the tab and whether that's the folder I want. These don't need to be labeled because you can see the top page (you can just leave your papers in there or make a project cover sheet, which will show through the clear plastic.)They are sturdy, retain the pages so much better than paper folders, and withstand anything that spills or drops on them. No more crinkled folders and pages, no more coffee cup rings.Very protective for files that need to go with you to a job site or construction site. Overpriced at most stored, but less than half the cost on Amazon.Highly recommended.",1
This was a great cart I ordered for the office. Durable and just as the picture. They also arrive quickly when we express them. I'm definitely happy with this item!,1
"Purchased this Starter Kit and two extra key-chain remotes from ExTenOnline. We've had problems with our garage door opening unexpectedly; can't find a short, and think we're either getting some radio interference or purposeful hacking by neighborhood kids. Our order from ExTenOnline arrived promptly and was well packed. Tried the tranceiver and remotes out on a lamp, first, to make sure they'd work like we wanted them to. Any of the remotes would turn on or off the tranceiver, and thus the power to the lamp. (They were interchangeable; we could turn the power off with one, on with another, back off with the third.) Plugged the garage door opener into the tranceiver, taped one of the remotes to the wall by the garage door switch, and attached one remote to each of our two, portable garage door openers. Now when we're leaving the house, we can turn the tranceiver off remotely from inside the car after the garage door has closed. When I get home, I just use the remote to turn the power back on, then use the garage door opener like usual to open the door. We can also leave the garage door power off at night while we're sleeping. This little device has eased our minds quite a bit, since we know there's no way that door's going to ""accidentally"" open as long as we've turned the tranceiver off. What a great invention, and it works just as well as advertised. I've been doing quite a bit of shopping for some gadget to get this job done, and the starter kit and two extra remotes were VERY inexpensive compared to some similar systems I've priced. I'd definitely recommend this.One quirk to mention: the tranceiver makes an audible (well, loud-ish) click when turned on or off. This is rather nice for us in our application of the device. If you were using the tranceiver to operate a lamp by someone's bedside, though, the noise might be an annoyance to you, or them.Hope this has helped.",1

"This phone has one of the best sound quality that I have heard on a cordless phone (and I have had many, including 900 analog and 900 dss types). It really minimizes static and other disruptions well. It does have great range as well, although it is not as good as the panasonic promotional material makes it sound.One thing that is often overlooked is that this phone is one of the few that uses the NiMH batteries instead of the old NiCd ones. This is a great improvement, as we all know how annoying it is to run out of juice in the middle of conversation.One minor con: the &quot;talk&quot; button on this phone is surprisingly small. You do get used to it, but you wonder, what was Panasonic thinking?Definitely get the headset for this phone. It is too cool and practical to not spend the extra $10-$20 for it. Might I recommend the Plantronic M110? I have the $10 ATT and it pinches my ear.",1
"I purchased my first calculator in 1973, an HP-35. I have used HP calculators ever since, the last being my HP-48 graphing calculator, which finally died, along with my HP 41C, which I had for over 20 years. As someone who ""grew up"" using RPN, I find it awkward to use algebraic calculators. RPN is definitely the superior calculator language. So when my HP-48 died, I looked at the HP line. As a chemistry teacher, I don't need the graphing utility (some people may want that, but I don't use it often enough to justify the difference in price or size), so I looked at the HP 35s as being the best calculator for my needs. Also, since it can be switched to algebraic mode, I can lend it to my students for quick calculations, not possible with the older HP's. My only complaint would be the two-line screen. It is something I am not used to, so I find it distracting. I wish there was a way to turn off one of the lines (maybe there is, but I haven't found it in the manual). All and all, a great value in an RPN calculator.",0
"I loved it from the minute I took it out of the box. So sturdy! So compact! It stands solidly upright when folded!And then . . . I actually used it to carry a stack of cartons. Unlike a big, clunky, rigid handtruck, this one turns on a dime. In fact, it doesn't turn, it glides. Tight corners? No problem!And once the cartons are loaded into the car, the cart folds up and pops in right next to them. When you return from the delivery, it's light enough to easily carry back inside.There's no downside to this sweet little hand truck, and the price makes it an incredibly good buy. I'm so glad I got it.",1
"I got this sharpener for my elementary students to use. I have designated responsible students as ""The Pencil Sharpeners."" Sadly enough within 2 months, these students would start with this electric sharpener and then move to the old fashioned crank model. They got tired of struggling to get a point on pencils with this 2 month old DULL electric sharpener. Sadly I have to admit that I bought one of these sharpeners once before, and it quickly wore out. Why did I buy it again? I'm a lowly paid teacher who can't afford to personally shell out $50 for worthless pencil sharpeners. Something tells me from the ratings that X-Acto knows they are ripping teachers off!",0
I have several of these (4 older same avery# and 3 newer) sadly the new ones no longer come with the metal opening lever. Pictures shown on Amazon are still of the old metal tabbed version not the weak plastic ones that are being shipped in the last few months.

This is a nice phone for the price. Very easy to set up and works great. Very clear reception.,1
"My old 32S-II died, and I wanted an RPN calculator to replace it. My ancient 15C is still running fine, but I keep it at home so I don't have to haul calculators back and forth. My antediluvian HP 45 is still functional, but barely. I really like RPN calculators.I bought a 33S despite the funky keyboard. I found I could adapt to the oddball chevron key layout, and the tiny decimal point only bothered me occasionally. What drove my 2 star rating is the poor life of the calculator. It lasted barely more than a year, and then completely died. HP nevermore. I guess I'm stuck typing silly parentheses into my new $10 Casio fx-260 Solar. If that one dies, I'll just send in some boxtops and get another. ""Ave atque vale,"" RPN.",0
"This is NOT an HP calculator. It is a cheap Chinese-made calculator which imitates the look of the old HP calculators and has HP's logo on it. It is sad that HP is turning into nothing more a marketing company for this kind of garbage.The calculator is all plastic, no metal case. The keys have painted on numbers, not molded plastic numbers, so they will quickly wear off. The button action is better than ""TI"" calculators but is still nowhere near what the original HP button touch was like.To give you a sense of just how cheap this thing is the numbers and symbols have been painted on with a digital process so they have jaggy edges. That's right: the edges of the characters are jaggy, not smooth. The paint also has poor coverage so there are little black spots where the underlying black plastic shows through.The silver lines on the edges of the calculator are not metal. They are just cheap painted-on silver lines meant to imitate the metal casing of the original.Extremely disappointing.",0

"I received this pen from my wife as an anniversary gift and love it. It writes very well without skipping or any other problems in bold strokes that look great on most papers. It does tend to run a bit on grainier papers but this may be partially because of the medium nib. It's also easy to refill though to refill the converter, I'd recommend removing it from the pen and refilling it directly rather than refilling through the nib, which can make a mess and wastes ink. An excellent pen, I just need to convince the wife to let me get another one!",1
"As far as I am concerned, Panasonic makes the best cordless phones. I bought this one to replace the prior unit I owned which was still perfectly functional after almost ten years of service. I upgraded solely for the features. The feature set hasn't fundamentally changed you still have Caller ID, Call Waiting Caller ID, Speed Dial, Directory, etc. But Panasonic continues to add valuable features, for example, I like the distinctive ring and color alert features as well. They also include the ability to record your own ring tones which works very well and is easy to implement - I had it up and running in within five minutes of getting it home.",1
"It was simple to install and works like it was discribed. It also looks good, but correct function is about all that can be asked.",1
"Bought and charged it overnite excited about its features then when its time to use it, its got horrible sound after few minutes. I used it for about 5 minutes then went to work. When I came back at night I used it again for about 10 mins and the phone cut me off! The battery is dead! I can't believe it. One day standby time, hissing sound after about 5 minute talking is enough for me to go back to Target. Bye bye Vtech that is my first and last phone from you.",0

"I am a CPA that uses my calculator every day. I had another one for over 20 years until it went last year. I looked everywhere and finally found this one. What I like most is that it has adding machine logic. That means it works like an adding machine not a typical calculator. If you have to add many numbers, some positive and some negative, you can enter them and hit the sign after the number. In a calculator you have to know the sign before you enter the number. The big keys and large type face are plusses too. I hope to use this one till I retire (not joking).",1

I am not stupid and can read the instructions, but there is no reason to make a menu system this convoluted-Very difficult to scroll through the list of missed calls, and no indicator light to tell you when people called-only one line for caller ID so it cycles through name and number one at a time - extremely annoyingThe pros:It does have some good ring tonesStyle factor is good",0

There's a simple switch to turn the ringer off (that's what made me impulse-buy it at Walgreens store).I can't tell you anything else about the phone, as I only used it for 5 minutes before discovering the ""no jack"" problem and packing back up to return to store.I'm going for a new DECT phone. They seem like they might have decent sound quality. Message playback audio quality has been quite poor in the Uniden phones I've had.",0

The labels that I received were so old that there was no E-date and the black sleeves were sealed with tape. One package included an ""EggHead"" (gone for >10 years!) price sticker. Despite ordering TWO units, the vendor charged me $4.95 shipping for Each, sent them via USPS ""Media Mail"" (Postal Fraud?) and the actual postage paid for both, in a single package was $2.53.

"We used to have a single handset cordless phone, but somehow the handset never seemed to be in the same part of the house as we were whenever the phone rang. Except for the obvious benefit of the aerobic exercise known as &#8220;the phone dash&#8221;, we decided to switch to a phone that offered more options, and we chose Panasonic because of the reliability of their equipment.Now we have three handsets in convenient places, and we are never that far away from a phone when it rings. The phones are easily identifiable for each location, and you can page from one to another. This is very handy when you are upstairs, and need somebody downstairs to do something for you (like bring a glass of water for example.) You can also program each one with a different ring tone if you want to.The bases and handsets are fairly small and don&#8217;t take up too much space. They are also aesthetically pleasing for most decors, or easy to hide if they don&#8217;t fit in. There&#8217;s Call Waiting and Caller ID, and an answering machine where you can record your own distinctive message. You can check messages from any handset, and also play back old messages if you wanted to. The only problem so far is that once you answer a call, the other two handsets record this as a missed call, so lesser used units rack up the missed calls at an alarming rate.You can store numbers and do all sorts of other things once you&#8217;ve read the manual (which of course I haven&#8217;t) but it&#8217;s all menu driven and fairly idiot proof even if I say so myself. The handset displays even tell you when they need charging, and when they&#8217;re ready to go again, and light up so you don&#8217;t have to fumble with buttons in the dark.Add all this to the clarity of the sound, and you know that this is a winner all the way.Amanda Richards, March 4, 2006",1
"This product is nothing what I expected. Amazon gave me all they specs on the product, but said nothing about it having only one ringtone and it sounded annoying. I have had GE clock/radios before and they were a lot better quality than this particular model. The clock is hard to set and there is a large AM antenna that is very inconvenient. Lastly, the return policy is a real pain. You do not deal with Amazon, but with an electronics store in Brooklyn, NY (not even GE). It sounded like someone working out of their garage and I was charged a restocking fee. From now on, I will only order books and music CD's from Amazon, so I will know what I am truly receiving.",0
"Most cordless phones theses days are a dissappointment. The Uniden TRU8866 and TCX860 are an improvement in usability, but still have some serious shortcomings.1. Their microphone reception are very faint (to point of inaudability) on Hello direct and Plantronics headsets that work fine on other phones. Uniden's answer is ""buy a Uniden headset."" Right. Box doesn't say Only works with Uniden Headset.2. Their touch tones don't work on many voice response systems I've encountered. My other phones do.3. While handset voice quality is good, range is less than any other cordless phone I have. Barely the length of my small house.I won't buy anymore handsets for this system and can't recommend it for the above reasons. I give two stars because they do have some novel features and if they fixed the above would be great.",0
What kind of company sends a 2010 appt. book in middle of December of 2010 for 2011? Amazon was great at immediately crediting back my money. Would not order anything again from this company. Ridiculous.,0
"Received this printer from Amazon last night and was really thrilled with its capabilities. I wanted an all-in-one unit for my office that didn't take up a lot of desk real estate . This is the third HP printer I've owned during the last 10 years or so and I knew the things were bullet proof. After researching various multiple capability printers I decided to purchase another HP. It will take you about an hour to set it up. The instructions were clear and the software loaded on my XP machine without problems, although it will place about 800 megs of programs on your computer if you go for the full install. Everything works intuitively and you will be copying, faxing, printing or scanning in just a few minutes. I was particularly impressed with the copy quality. When you copy a black and white typed letter, you will be hard pressed to see much of a difference between the original and the copy. And you can even feed the original into the machine via a paper feeder just like the expensive Xerox copiers. Most functions can be accomplished by pressing only one or two buttons but if you need more capabilities such as copy reduction or sending a scan to your e-mail or to Microsoft Word, they can be activated through the menu system. The unit is quieter than my previous HP 842C and prints faster. It's made in China and my experience with Chinese electronics has been poor at best. I hope the HP quality I've come to expect has been retained.",1
"The entire unit itself has definitely been overrated by many reviewers. The main deficiency of this unit is the answering machine. Everything about the digital answering machine is terrible. You cannot hear what people are saying because either the message is garbled, the sound is not loud enough, or both. My sister says she can't even hear the ""please leave a message"" message on her phone when her call is answered by the machine. If the power goes out or if you unplug the unit you have to re-record your outgoing message unless you've bought a custom back-up battery from Motorola which is expensive. The machine itself is grievously void of features like being able to play the first or last few seconds of a message. You cannot delete a message unless you are in the middle of playing it which makes no sense.The phone part of it is really good, frankly. My only complaints about it are that the speakerphone on the base unit has a really cheap microphone which requires you stand close to the unit and speak really loud into it which is sometimes a little embarrassing and also that the handset sometimes lacks sufficient volume, but rarely.I would highly recommend the MD671 (this review is for the MD681) because the 671 is the exact same unit without the answering machine, therefore you pay less money. That is the reason I only gave this one star. You're basically buying the 671 and paying a much higher price for an answering machine that you most likely won't use. I'm shopping for a new answering machine right now so that my relatives can actually hear the outgoing message. Good luck!",0
Very easy to use. Volume control a real plus. Replaces and older pastel trimline phone in a somewhat formal room. Fills the bill marvelously. Good value for money.,1
This is the worst amazon item ever. The colored pencils which were bought expensively do not work. Every time you sharpen them they break. I've been sharpening them with 7 different sharpeners. I do not recommend anybody to buy this. I actually do not recommend any human being to buy this. This is the worst coloring set in history. I wasted my time and money buying this when it doesn't even get sharpened. It is very easily breakable.,0
"Some of the reviews I've written required much research. This is the exception. The Namiki Vanishing Point Fountain Pen really does have a nib (point) which fully retracts inside the pen-- It is the finest fountain pen I've used in 30 years of being totally immersed (no pun intended) in the world of ""&Eacute;criture d'&Eacute;l&eacute;gance"" (ie elegant writing). Yes, I know all about the ""other brands"" like: Montblancs (not good for heavy handed persons such as myself). Same for Parker (too drab), Dupont (too pricey), Cross (cheap), Pelikans (they leak-even the pricey ones), Waterman (so-so). I've tried all of the aforementioned, but always came back to Namiki, which is why I now have three of them, all with different types of nibs. And speaking of nibs (the point which actually does all the work). Although Namiki makes a wonderful flexible gold nib, I love italics and calligraphic writing styles. The beauty of the Namiki is that custom nibs for this pen are far easier to obtain than others. There are several very excellent pen craftsmen with websites access who will actually measure exactly the way you write and fit you with the proper custom machined Namiki nib. Why Namiki? Ah, that's the beauty of it all. Because this is the ONLY fountain pen which has all of it's ""guts"" in one small affordable package. The pen is over $100. but that is actually inexpensive compared to some of the brands which run well over $1,000 for ONE fountain pen. However, the entire nib assembly--everything, can be replaced for between $30-$40. That, in my opinion, is well worth the price of this pen. Also, I have NEVER had this pen (in any of my three Namikis) leak. Replacing the cartridge or filling from a bottle is exceptionally carefree and easy . I would advise using the wonderful Namiki cartridges which can be changed in a few seconds easier than ball points. I'm ambidextrous, but favour my left hand. The Namiki is wonderful both for left or right handed writing. In short, don't just sit there--go out and get one of these great fountain pens--and yes you can still write through carbonless copies.",1
Every thing went so smooth! And I got the shipment so quickly! Thanks for your promt shipment and the great product.,1
I am very pleased with the arm rest and mouse pad they are comfortable and look good with the iMac.,1
"This is a beauty. It has the look and feel of a first class writing instrument. It can be changed to accommodate your own writing style with a felt tip, rolling ball, or a standard ball point (not sure about the ball point, but then why would anyone choose to write with a ball point pen?).Highly recommended. I have owned other so called quality pens but this is the best buy for my money.",1
"I have found that the TrueBlock line of products comes in handy when re-using boxes. Labels from this product line are thick enough to completely cover old labels. They also tend to peel very easily from the sheet, but to stick very securely to packages. I have not had a single label jam in the printer. Finally, they seem to resist wrinkling while being applied to boxes better that any other label i have used.",1
We've used these folders for years in our physician office and have found them to be very durable and long-lasting.,1
"I love this phone since the reception is outstanding. Battery life seems to be very good (we have never ran out of battery). Two annoying accessories are missing. A belt clip is very useful if you want to use a headset. I noticed that it wasn't included in the package but I figured I could always buy one later. I was wrong. Second it is also missing a wall mount. Because I wanted to used these two items and they are not available (I was OK with them not being included), I dropped my rating 1 star. If these two items are not important to you, this is a fantastic phone!",0
"Bought 2 years ago. Worked fine first, then...the static started its aggravating thing. I keep asking people to repeat what they are saying. Finally, abandonned the handset. Now I am tied up to the phone base. Then why did I buy a cordless phone? To be able to move freely around the house! This phone did not work out for me...",0
These pens are okay. I had 2 that didn't work for long but what the hell it is just a pen.,0
"Cheap stitching, the ""leather"" smells of plastic. Very flimsy, not professional looking at all and DEFINITELY not worth the money. On a positive note, the vendor was very nice on the phone.",0
"Pretty phone - worked for about a month, then the answering machine picks up once in a while, so for someone monitoring calls, setting the phone for two rings, four rings, two again, on, off, unplugging, replugging, trying the best possible placement of the phone in the cradle, checking the level of the base to make sure everything is sound, truly disappointed if this phone is actually this sensitive ... I can't help but wonder how many important calls I missed. I hear only the phone in a back room ring. There is no life in the Vtech - a light flickers for a moment on the led screen, but no ring on the crappy little Vtech. There is no pick up from the answering machine after two rings (where it's set), four rings, fifteen rings. I sit here, call my land line from my cell phone several times over and see this ""sexless"" (you said it had sex appeal) phone do nothing. I picked it up when my mother called, knowing she was calling - no rings, no answer machine. It took a minute for the connection, I said ""hello, hello,"" and then we connected after a pause. Vtech is just another tribute to planned obsolecense and consumerism, attached to your wallet like a disease. My best phone: it's in the back of my closet, circa 1992 Panasonic with state of the art digital voice recording chip, a thousand cables and cords I didn't want to see and a ten dollar Princess phone that loyally rings in a back room. Thank you Vtech for your contribution to the planet... another piece of plastic crap to throw on the junk pile now filling in the ocean. Global warming, man? Nope, just useless plastic melting in the sun and causing more heat. How sexy is that?",0
"Bad from day one. Can't handle more than one or two sheets of paper at a time (though it claims six), and even then starts to jam and overheat after three minutes or so. By comparison, I had my previous shredder for seven years of near-perfect operation (had to leave it behind in a move). Strongly recommend that Fellowes simply take this product off the market.",0
"Love the laptop desk for my laptop. Fits my lap and is not too heavy. The lamp is the right light for darkness, not too bright, not too dim. I use it every evening to browse the net or to eat dinner in front of the TV. I have enjoyed my lapdesk with light since I got it and I would definantly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a lapdesk.",1
"My husband and I bought the base unit with two phones in it and decided that the twins needed one in each of their rooms so they could call their Dad and friends and such. The programming was so way super easy, and after 24 hours of charging, they have had phones in their room so I don't have to hear all the little school gossiping.....lol. We really like these phones, they fit well in our hands and work perfectly for VoiP which is what we are using it for. God Bless!!!",1
"Well worth the price if you care about security or just have a penchant for turning junk mail into teeny-tiny bits of junk mail.This shredder replaced an old strip cut shredder used for destroying junk mail. The old strip cut shredder, while less expensive, was loud, ineffective and didn't provide good security. This shredder is super quiet, consumes the average junk mail, credit card offer or even the thicker cell phone bill in a single pass leaving only the tiniest bits of paper.The shredder is so good that it becomes very easy to run nearly all the junk mail I get through it. Now I only take the paper out of the envelope (so I can unfold the contents for easier feeding into the machine -- not too much of a burden) and let the shredder do its job. I'd give it more than 5 stars if it were possible!",1
"CONS - This paper cutter can only cut 4 or 5 pages at a time. Any more than that and the cut gets tougher, uneven and sometimes sloppy. It does not have a rear guard to keep papers flush. One must use the left hand to hold papers in place while using right hand to lower cutting arm. Cutting arm does not spring up. It must be raised manually.PROS - Sturdy plastic, lightweightIf I had to replace this, I would try a different Paper Cutter.",0
I purchased this for my office and it is perfect. I have it on my credenza and my printer sits on top and I keep &#34;pending&#34; files under. It is very well made and went perfect with my desk.,1
"This is one serious pencil sharpener. I have absolutely no complaints about its functionality- it sharpens fast and clean, with a nice point. What may not be evident from the picture is that this pencil sharpener is large and it is HEAVY! I couldn't believe how heavy the package was when it arrived. Given the price and heft, this is not a casual pencil sharpener for one's desk. This is for a high-pencil usage situation- a classroom, an SAT testing center, or similar. If you're looking for a high usage, high volume sharpener, this would fit the bill.",1
"Purchased this shredder on February 17th 2010. Within the last week, the gears started slipping and anything more than a single sheet of paper causes it to stall.Prior to that, it was a very good shredder. But, getting just 15 months of use from a $200+ shredder is very disappointing.",0

"This phone is well built and solid. It's made out of real brushed metal, not plastic or cheaper materials. It has on the bottom a volume switch, a ringer on/off switch, and a switch that changes between pulse and touch tone dialing. Sound quality is excellent. I don't think you could do much better when it comes to buying a replica phone.I also should note that while the phone looks good, it is completely ready for the 21st century. I use voip.ms (a wholesale voice over IP provider) for phone service rather than a traditional land line. Everything works perfectly, I can get all the usual features, such as call waiting and voicemail. The only thing you have to watch out for is the rotary/touch tone switch, because out of the box this came set for rotary pulse dialing, and voice over IP supports only touch tone phones. So if you hear a lot of clicking and keep getting reset to a dial tone, make sure you flip that switch.",1
"The Vtech I6775 5.8GHz 3-Handset System with Digital Answering Device and Caller ID is very easy to set up and use without the help of its user's manual.The display is easy to read and the ringer volume options are better than all of my previous cordless phones which were either too loud or too quiet, without much mid-range volume.This phone is a bargain in its price range.",1
"I have had this product for a little over a year. It does not hold up well. In addition to being difficult to program, the sound quality is deteriorating and the keypad on all of the handsets have become difficult to use. I sincerely regret having purchased with product.",0

"I am pretty sure that my administrative assistant is a saint since she can put up with me on a daily basis. So for her birthday, I tried to get her a gift that could somehow begin to repay her. Since gift cards are bushleague gifts, I tried to think of something different.Enter this footrest. Our office has furniture from the seventies, before ""ergonomics"" was actually a word, and her desk requires her to sit with her feet dangling in order to type. So it's either ankle problems or carpal tunnel. This footrest worked perfectly to update her office space into something that doesn't immediately prompt a call from OSHA. It adjusts in every way imaginable. The one downside is that moving the height is a bit of a pain, and as others have pointed out, the instructions are not exactly detailed -- in fact they are just brightly colored pictures.That being said, it works, and she loves the gift. So if you are trying to find a gift with utility for that special someone who keeps you organized (read: employed), this wouldn't be a bad one (note: a good campanion gift is a well-deserved raise).",1

"This pencil sharpener was FABULOUS when I first got it. After a short while, maybe a month, it only worked properly with ""good"" pencils (i.e. Ticonderoga. It did NOT sharpen those gummy pretty pencils, nor office depot/ office max pencils). Now it rarely works at all. Admittedly, I use a pencil sharpener a lot. I am a teacher and this is my 5th electric sharpener in two years.",0
"I received this trimmer in the nick of time while I was preparing for a major Art Show. It was very useful for the smaller prints, but is not quite large enough for the 11x14 prints that I also sell. While the lock feature at times can be a bit laborious it also insures that the paper is cut straight-something that my last rotary printer had a problem with. In all it works well, especially for small photo trimming.",1
"Oh. My. These chaco liners are, hands down, the best marking tools out there. I have tried pens, pencils, regular chalk, you name it. These little things go on stretchy and dark fabric like magic. The little serrated wheel turns smoothly and dispenses just the right amount of chalk.I have the white and yellow ones, and both are great for marking on dark fabrics, such as stretch velvet. I could not mark properly with anything on dark stretch velvet before-thanks to these, it is now a breeze.The tip is narrow so you can get close to a ruler or the pattern paper.At under $6 they are so worth their price!

"If this is the pen I think it is, I had one while in the University. I still own it, but the converter is no good and I'm not fond of cartridges. If it's a new model, there was one like it in the past, and it was a joy to write with. I actually had two pens of the same model, only one turned out to have a nib that was too broad for me.By the way, in those days a fountain pen cost much less than it does now and more people wrote with fountain pens. As a matter of fact, for some documents (for example, checks) ballpoint pens were not allowed.",0
I own this stapler and used it less than 50 times. The metal plate that bends the staples is made of cheap metal and the staple pushed out the bottom of it making the stapler useless. Of course the label on the bottom states that it was proudly produced in China. The plate on my basic paper stapler is more robust. I am going to try to return under warranty. The only issue is that I am sure a replacement will fail in the same way given that it is now made from pig metal compared to older model staplers.I reiterate this is JUNK. Buy quality and suffer once.,0
"I have had this phone for a little over a year now. At first it seemed to be pretty good, but not a few months later the battery would not hold a charge and had to be replaced. Another big issue, is that the #1 and # 2 buttons on the cordless phone either don't work at all, or when they do work it dials the number twice.",0
Loved the phone the minute I saw it. It was perfect for my new kitchen... but my calls kept getting cut off. I contacted the mfg several times for a replacement receiver and never got a return email or call. I proceeded to contact Amazon and they issued me a 1 time exception return because the mfg has not gotten back to me. I'm now looking for the same retro look but from another company.,0

"I bought this phone a couple of years ago. The phone kept getting very hot so I returned it and the new one did the same thing. I also noticed that the sound quality was not as good as my old AT&T or Panasonic land line phones. After about a year of using it, I started hearing a lot of static on the line. Of course, it was out of warranty and they would not help me. I could have gotten it fixed but it was cheaper to buy a new phone. I noticed that the price has really gone down for this phone.. I wonder why? Hmmmm could it be a quality problem? Not worth the money.",0

"Once you are sure it's compatible with your current cordless phone, this headset is a great product. I discovered the feature that allows you to copy your phone book to the other handset(s) and use it all the time.

"While this review is for the KX-TG2700 - it may apply to this phone as they look exactly alike and may be using the same battery.Okay, here's how frustrated I am - I've logged into Amazon just so that I can complain about this phone system.I purchased this system a little over a year ago and it has had two battery issues.The first was with the handset that came with the base station - it would not hold a charge. Panasonic support - which was good - informed me that they were aware of the problem. Apparently the battery wasn't making solid contact so Panasonic sent me two pinky-sized pads with directions to stick them on the underside of the battery compartment. These pads were devised to assist with the seating of the battery and they seemed to work.Fast forward a year later - second issue:The handset is no longer holding a charge more than 20 minutes nor is the phone/clock radio (KX-TGA272). Normally, this would be annoying enough - but it gets better. Both phones go dead while showing 1/3 battery life remaining. This often happens while talking to someone. But my favorite part is when the phone/clock radio goes dead - it wipes out the time and alarm settings!So...good luck with the batteries!",0
This product comes with check printing software that is easy to set up and use. The check paper is of high quality and all checks have been processed with no problems. We will be using this indefinitely.,1
Worked good until the handset audio quality all of the sudden became very poor overnight.

Not fair and wont buy their phones again.,0

"After just a few days of hearing the constant hum of the Olympia Digital Caller ID, I wanted to rip it out of the wall. Nonetheless, I kept it going for two full months to see if I would get used to it. Nope. Every time I walked into the family room where we had installed it, my attention was drawn to it and the annoying noise it made. Today, I unplugged it at last, and I can't tell you how relieved I am. I only wish I had the courage to toss this device earlier.The globe looks cool in a Star Wars kind of way, although it's fairly large for placing next to a phone, about 5"" in diameter and 5"" high. While the numbers are easy enough to read except in the glare of sunlight, the unit did not always register the caller ID numbers. The phone would ring, and I'd look across the room. Nothing. When I went to the phone itself, the number would be displayed on the phone but not on this unit, so the loss of functionality had nothing to do with blocked numbers. Still, it did work on occasion, and for that, I give it two stars. The time and date display is nice if you don't have other clocks in the room.I don't recommend this product primarily because of the constant -- and I mean, CONSTANT -- noise.",0
"I bought one of these a couple of years ago, for sporadic use. I've used it maybe a dozen times, light use each time. Last use was probably six months ago. I took it out, changed the batteries, and discovered that it no longer powers on. I also tried using a DC power adapter with no luck.",0
"I guess I am just used to using statistical and graphing calculators during my lifetime. Now that I am earning a degree in Accounting I have switched to a Financial calculator and have had no prior experience with them. It will take some getting used to if you have never used one. I have noticed that you must program the amount of decimal places. I have done work depletion problems and had a result of dollars per ton to 2 decimal places. I immediately multiplied this amount by the amount of tons mined and came up with the wrong answer. Why? I didn't realize that the answer per ton only showed 2 decimal places and it multiplied by the entire answer, not just to 2 decimal places. This threw my answer off by a small amount. Also, you need to look at the numbers you are entering, because the keypad sticks. Numerous times I have been pushing the appropriate numbers and only about 90% of them make it on to the screen on the first press. I feel that I need to hammer down on the keypad to get the numbers in on the first push. This doesn't make for quick work. My TI-84 Plus Silver Edition works like a champ and am going back to that unless I absolutely need this calculator for schedules.",0

The alignment did not match the screw holes for attachment to the bottom of the seat. This panel was held in place with glue in addition to screws. The panel had to be broken away from the seat so that the mounting screws would align with the pre-drilled holes in the seat. In breaking the glue, some of the wood tore loose from the seat.There were a couple of minor issues as well.Quality control at the factory obviously was of poor quality.",0
"This is the most annoying piece of junk I have bought in ages. The instructions tell you to feed the tape before use. What they don't say is you have to type up a label before the feed button will work. I took the first one back because I thought it was defective. Once I figured this out on the second one I printed some labels. The big problem is peeling the backing off the labels. There is a peeler slot on the thing but pictures in the instructions are so small and bad they are useless, and following the text instructions doesn't work. Peeling off the backing by hand requires the patience of a saint and the dexterity of a fly tying fly fisherman. Its OK if you just want to label your stereo, but if you need to label a few hundred files this thing is a joke. You will have to spend hours coaxing the backing off the label tape.",0
"Unfortunately this is a bad translator at least for Japanese. I am a native Japanese speaker and I found many definitions and translations don't make sense at all. Even very simple words, such as ""rain"" or ""bridge"" don't show accurate definitions. It's better not to use such a translator, otherwise you might have miscommunication with native speakers.",0
"Shame on you Sony! This was a great printer that cost me 40 cents per print back in the day -- expensive but worth the quality. Now the supplies are so highly priced prints cost about $3.00 each. I paid $160 for this printer. It's going in the trash and I'm getting a Canon Selphy CP900. Someone is making too much money on this and Sony is helping to fill our landfills. Fellow consumers unite and don't buy Sony products. Corporate shenanigans like this are disgraceful -- and perhaps illegal. (I recall reading you can't sell retail products in New York State (where I live) over the MSRP.) Thus depending on Sony's MSRP it may be the retailers at fault. Whomever is behind this, I hope some watch dog reads this and calls you on this one. Consumers, your power is the power not to consume. Help send a message.",0
"I bought this thing so many years ago I can't remember when. I think I bought it (new) for $70 or less after a manufacturer rebate, I can't believe several years later it costs $300.I use it mostly to copy a single sheet of paper once a week. I've sent and received a few faxes over the years with no problems. When buying paper, I recommend grainy stock over glossy stock. The glossy paper is difficult for the rollers to move through the machine, causing jams.",0
"Gel ink pens are great, better than ballpoint, rollerball or liquid ink... because they tend to write really smoothly over many surfaces (computer paper, lined notebook paper, backs of photographs, copy paper, recycled paper, newsprint, post-it notes, etc.). However, I've found this pen really doesn't like to dispense ink from time to time after a few weeks of opening the package. And there's plenty of ink visible in the barrel! Shaking the pen so as to force more ink to the writing tip doesn't help much, either.There are better gel ink pens out there, such as Uni-Ball(R)'s Signo 207, which is a fabulous gel ink retractable rollerball.",0
"I bought this machine from walmart for about 12 dollars about 6 months ago. It has a nice compact design, however it doesn't work properly. It didn't even record a message I thought I had left earlier. It's gonna find it's new home in my trash bag. The old fashioned tape ones still have an edge in voice quality. Look elsewhere for a good answerer, this one's a P.O.S.",0
Love this product because it is very stable and I like the fact that it is open for easy access and on wheels for mobility.,1
"I bought my TeleZapper for use with a new Motorola 2.4 GHz Digital cordless phone. Whenever I press the &quot;ON&quot; or the &quot;HANDS-FREE&quot; buttons on the handset, the phone emits a loud and annoying beep. This makes it very difficult to hold the handset close to you ear when you make or take a phone call. When I disconnect the TeleZapper, this loud tone is not present.Anyone else have this problem?",0

"I've been using Avery's 5267 product to make return address labels for some time now, but despite the increasing quaintness of postal mail, I still have a few people and companies that I mail things to every so often, so tried out Avery's 5260 address labels for laser printers to print up some address labels. They just work.If you haven't used this type of product, it's a breeze if you have almost any working version of Microsoft Word, because Word has built-in templates for Avery's various labels. Just open or create a document, type in the address you want on the label, select Mailings/Labels (in Word 2007 - varies by version), tell it that you want to use Avery 5260 labels, and Word knows how to lay out the page and to replicate the text 30 times to fill out a page of identical labels. Or you can give Word a list of addresses from a mailing list and it will lay them out to fit on the Avery product.This appears to be a new generation of Avery's line of labels, with ""pop-up edges"" to make it easier to peel each label from the page, as compared to older versions which required you to bend the page or pry out each label with your fingernails. Amazing how it's possible to improve even a seemingly mundane product.Anyway, these just work and I don't even think about them when creating or using them - which to me is the definition of usefulness and quality.",1
"I did not expect a whole let, considering the price and length of tape. I did not need the tape to attach carpet to carpet directly. I use industrial strength velcro, which is wide and sticky, but runs $30 for 15 feet. I only use the ""hook"" portion of the velcro. I don't use the other half of the velcro (the velvety side). The adhesive side attaches to the runner, and the hook side attaches to the carpet. It works quite well to keep the runner from crawling along the grain of the carpet. However, over time, threads from the runner break away and the runner breaks loose. The adhesive side is now worthless. I was throwing out the velcro and using a new strip.Voila, a much cheaper solution is to use this double stick tape to adhere the velcro back on the rug. It's only been a day, but it appears to be working. Also, this tape can double for other double stick tape (such as Scotch double stick tape0 for projects, and it runs A LOT cheaper. Just look up the price of Scotch double stick.I don't know where this is shipped from, but it arrived the next day (I do have Prime, but products usually arrive two full days after ordering (e.g. a Monday night order arrives Wednesday or Thursday. I have ordered a second role once I realized the tape's other utilitarian uses.",0
"This is my fourth GE bedroom phone. My first was so good it has made me keep trying GE to find a replacement, but none of the newer phones can hold a candle to the 1st. This model like it's predecessor is flawed. It is beginning to drops calls. I will be in the middle of a conversation when the line goes dead and all I hear is static. The older model was really bad about dropping call while this new model has only done it twice, so far. Also, the caller ID doesn't display the call 4 out of 5 calls. This is very frustrating!I'm holding my breath that things don't get worse, but... Buyer beware. I like the phone otherwise. It has good features and I like that it is cordless, but the corded models were more dependable.",0
"This phone is truly a remarkable piece of technology that has connected me with my friends and family like never before. The video is in real time and the sound is just like a regular telephone. You can even connect a DVD player or a camcorder to the unit to play back family videos to the other party on their video phone. I highly recommend getting this phone not only because of the video capabilities, but also because it is cheaper than regular home phone service! This is a definate winner in my book!",1
Great and sturdy phone. Used it for 2+ years without any problem until I discontinued comcast and moved to ATT wireless phones.,1
"I tried this mouse pad with 3 different mice; 2 optical and one laser. Sticky, jumpy, non-responsive. It looks to me like this pad was designed to be used with an old fashioned mouse with a ball. If your mouse has a ball, it should work fine, if it's optical, don't buy it. I will say however, that I returned the pad to the manufacturer and received an immediate refund with no problems, so the customer service is very good.",0

"My wife and I each bought a great office chair for our offices and she bought one brand while I bought a Human Scale chair. After three years, her chair is still perfect while my Human Scale has a number of issues.First, like everyone else replying here, my armrests are broken. What amount of crack was circulating in the design department when they conceived such a wretched idea? Screwing into plastic that is not all that dense. The parts are not some space age composite or some such. No, just plain old styrene from the looks of things and so the screws rip out and strip the plastic.Also, there are not many real controls on this and while my wife's chair allows her to adjust many different functions on the chair -- height, lower seat angle and where it sits in relation to the back, where the armrests sit and their angle, lumbar support, back angle, where the headrest sites, etc., etc. -- my Human Scale chair is at best a mediocre design with few user controlled features.If I could go back and buy something else, I would. But I bought the Human Scale because some friends recommended it. Now we all commiserate our broken armrests along with the others here.And to make matters worse, we bought our chairs back when they sold for nearly double what they sell for now. Ouch.",0
"First of all, despite the claim that it works with MacIntosh, it definately does not. There is a template that you can use in Mac with Word, Claris, and other photoshop software, but there are no instructions as to how. Once you think you have it figured out (on the page) it doesn't print the same as pictured. The technial support people have no idea how to make it work with Mac, and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers. In any case, they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the Word template for MacIntosh. Don't waste your money. (I gave it one star only because no stars is not an option.)",0
"The chair is attractive, but that's about it. The back rest offers no support and isn't even high enough for a person of average height to lean back comfortably if it did support his or her weight.The mechanism that sustains the chair's height failed after one day of use, and I am currently waiting for a replacement part. I would just return the chair, but the shipping cost is deducted from the refund. Being that it was around $60 to begin with, I'm not going to bother if all I'll get back is $10-$20.Aesthetically, the chair's ""bucket"" seat is awkward. The ridges for your thighs are deep and cascade to the back, making you slide back. Since there's no real back support, you have to overcompensate by leaning forward more.Don't buy this chair. Pay a little more and get a legitimate, well made, comfortable chair.",0

"The stand is fine for everything except mounting my Samsung 23"" monitor in the vertical position, which unfortunately is the reason I bought the stand.

"Given that monitor mounts from this manufacturer can cost upwards of $400 ([...]) this particular model is an excellent value at under $100. It supports my 9 lb. 24-inch Viewsonic display very well. The included flex-mount base raises the diagonal support arm 4"" above the desktop, providing good clearance when the arm is rotated. There are some minor deficiencies. Although the stiffness in the joints of the arm is eliminated with light lubrication, the rotational coupling, which is used to level the display and to rotate it 90-degrees, from portrait to landscape, remains very stiff. It sort of lurches from one position to the next so that you have to work with it to get the monitor straight. After you've leveled it, if the arm is then rotated horizontally from, say, right to left, or if the monitor is turned 180-degrees on its axis, without moving the arm, the display shifts out of true and must be leveled again. These are somewhat minor flaws, but they do undermine the ease of use and the overall build quality of the mount.",0
"The phone has a speaker phone with large numbers, well designed with buttons for fire and ambulance to program.Was pleasantly surprised to find it as the phone did not come up when I last searched for speaker phones.Had one of these before about fifteen years ago and wanted to find another one when that one no longer worked but could not, so this was a pleasant surprise.",1
"I've tried these transfers several times on several different types of fabrics and they simply do not work. I've been disappointed every time, after following the directions to the letter. The image did not transfer no matter how hot the iron and how much pressure I applied. Ruined a couple t-shirts in the process.Also, hp printing software will flip the image horizontally when you select ""iron-on transfer"" in printing properties, so if you have already flipped your image in the document, when you print onto the transfer paper the image will have flipped BACK without warning.

"This pen lives up to the hype; I love it. I've been doing field work for over 10 years and have had all sorts of stuff fall apart on me. I've used Rite in the Rain field books for years, but went through tons of pens that fell apart or died when a drop of rain or a snow flake fell. I used their other half plastic/half metal pen and it was great until the plastic part broke making the pen junk. This pen is the last pen you'll ever need.

Speakerphone is great in every way. It's very easy to operate. It looks great and fits comfortably in the hand. And, the price was very good, excellent if you buy it with the $30 rebate. I don't know what more a person could ask for in a phone with similar features??Some reviewers complain about poor sound quality but on my end the sound is crystal clear, even when using the handset speakerphone which is amazing. And, I have had no complaints from people on the other end of the line. I can't say enough good things about this phone and see absolutely no negatives.",1
"I am a big Skype user and talk to family and friends via my computer with the cam and love it. I thought that I would get the Netgear Skype phone so that I could use it in Sydney and at home in my WiFi. The phone that I got is obviously defective.

I was so tired of saying, ""pardon me."" I wanted to hang up. Long story short, finally the phone is going back and I am getting a replacement. However, I have to pay $16.90 for shipping for Netgears faulty product. My last wireless router from Netgear had a problem and I took it back. I just figured since Skype was behind this product, it would be better. I will not ever buy a Netgear product again. Beware of this item. I hope that the new one will work. We will see.",0
I've been using this sharpener for years. It sharpens to a perfect point. My kids even noticed that the sharpeners at school never make a sharp point like this product does. If you want it to last a long time you can't shove the pencil in you have to put it in just far enough to activate the device. You will hear when the pencil is sharp. If you force the pencil in and don't remove it once it's sharp you will break the machine very quickly.,0

"I was in need of some larger mailers and searched amazon and found these. The reviews were all good and the pictures showed an Eco-Lite mailer with a seam on 3 sides. That is NOT what I received. I received the cheaper Overseas made mailers with only seams on 2 sides and the padding does not appears as good as the reviews. I tried emailing the customers service email address on the card that came in the box and the reply was rather condescending, almost rude. I was told these were the premium mailers approved by all the mail services and I got received the best mailer available. The reply went on to insinuate I didn't know a mailer from a hole in the ground. Maybe I am not an expert on mailers, But I DO Expect to get What I order and what is displayed in their add. I also would like an email that address the concerns without the put down. This appears to be a Bait and Switch operation on my shipment.

Product arrived with 1/3 the box ripped off. Very poorly packaged but with good reason. Why provide good packaging for a piece of junk. Plastic frame is flimsy. As soon as I tried to lift it (from the center of the frame) the drawing board became detached. Could not easily get it back together. If you do buy this only hold it from the sides.

Messages coming from cell phones were usually impossible to decipher. The extra background noise added to the already poor sound quality just turned the messages to complete garble. Today, after two years, it just stopped answering. I turned it off, to see if I could reset it. It would not turn back on again. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. The lights came back on, but I don't know whether it is going to accept messages again.The buttons and settings were easy to use, so this was a plus.",0

"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. In fact, I advise against buying ANY Helio or VTech product. On top of selling a product that has yet to run properly in the two months that I've owned it, Helio's customer service and technical support is a travesty. They simply do not care if you are unhappy with their product and are not focused on improving your situation or making their customers happy. I am in the midst of sending scathing letters to the President, head of customer service and head of technical support demanding a full refund. Amazon.com should no longer carry these products.",0
"Great purchase. I was sick and tired of dropped internet connections (wireless) every time the phone was used. After researching consumer reports this was their top rated 1.9GHz phone (voice frequency only, no interference with wireless networks, baby intercoms/monitors, etc.).I've only had it for a day but I love it, and normally I don't bother writing reviews.Great clarity for conversations, great range (works perfect upstairs, downstairs, and anywhere in our yard). I also love that multiple handsets can conference in on the same call (great for family).The only drawback for me is the lack of a backlit keypad. With all the other features I'm still very happy though. I don't use the answering machine part so I can't comment on that, though it is easy to disable that feature.I no longer get kicked off the laptop when my wife is using the phone!",1
I bought this phone because I live in Japan and most cordless phones are off-limits. I found this in the Base Exchange and was excited. A cordless we are allowed to use. My first problem was the charger would not work so I began charging the bateries in the base unit. Then the memory button does not work. I have a difficult time accessing the memory button and the off button. Because I am using the base unit to charge the bateries the batery pack is now loose and the phone often will not work even with a full charge. It blacks out when I set it down. I have been very disapointed in this product and would advise every one to NOT buy it. It is too expensive to only get 5 good months of use out of.,0
"I really like these shelves. They feel solid, and, once assembled, the rack is rigid and not at all willowy. The assembly is simple (make sure you have twice the height of the rack in floorspace when you're doing the assmbly so that you can easily slide the rods into the bottom shelf one at a time).You can pay a lot more for wire shelving, but unless you're looking for industrial ruggedness these shelves should work well for you.",1
"Hello, first of all, the item was shipped and arrived as promised in the initial transaction and purchase. My family is extremely happy with the phone system. My teenage daughters (2) can now hide one of the extensions in their room and my wife especially likes the feature as where the phone from the home base can be missing and you can use the speaker/dialer option from the base to make a call in the absents of the cordless phone. And last, I have seen this phone onsale in my area at a local electronics stores and the price for the base and 2 extension phones was higher than the unit I bought from Amazon that included a 3rd extension. So in closing, if you have teenagers or just the need for a great phone with extension jacks, the product and price is unbeatable. And if your wondering if I was paid for these comments, NO! my only payment was the reciept of a great product.",1
"I had purchased the basic set of Tarifold Display Pockets and wanted another set of the pockets to expand the whole system.

They are a great price compared to the requested product pricing. They are the same quality as the expensive product. The only downfall I found was the removal of the backing when applying label.

"This phone has some good features. The handset size is great, the flexibility of the 2nd phone without needing a 2nd phone jack is wonderful. However, I can't believe all the static they have. Every slight movement of my head caused a great deal of static. I'm also a bit leery of the phones since they are analog 5.8 Ghz rather than digital. This means that security is much lower than a 5.8 Ghz Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS) system.I'm returning mine as soon as possible. Good ergonomics is wonderful, but the static isn't worth it. Uniden used to be the best major manufacturer of phones, particularly cordless, but their quality has fallen significantly.",0

"Perfect for sending out 5x7 pictures to family and friends. They're a little thin, but not so much so that it feels like the photos will be damaged. Plus - they were cheaper here than any other place I looked. Exactly what we need.",1
"I have been writting in a journal for over 40 years. I am not Hemingway or Chatwin but my journalling is important to me. Moleskine provides a perfact tool for journalling, note taking, doddleing and even keepsake holding. The small ones are best, you can put them in your pocket and take them any where, they can stand up to alot of travelling abuse. It's not difficult having a good idea it's just difficult remembering it. Moleskines are friends who remind you.",1
"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday cards. They are heavystock, take ink great and look professional. Unfortunately, as another reviewer said you can't find them anymore. If you find them, stock up they are the best.",1
"I purchased this phone for two reasons: 1) the claim that it is interference free and 2) for it's beautiful design. When it arrived to my office, I immediately plugged it in to charge it so it would be ready to use when I got home. Once home, I plugged it in and it looked great in my living room. I then took it off its cradle and tried to make my first phone call. There was so much static that I could barely hear the dial tone even while standing right next to the base station. Because this is a DECT phone, there wasn't a way to switch channels as in other cordless phones. I tried relocating the base station to the opposite side of the house and encountered the same problem. I've since returned the phone.",0
"when i was searching for one of these it was for my mom for a christmas gift this year. That was all she asked for. When I saw this one I liked it. it looked nice, big enough to hold letter without them hanging over and it also looked like it could hold them sideways.But when she got it and opened it up. It was totally different. Not at all what the picture looked like. I was very disappointed. Of course she hung it up. i dont understand if your going to advertise a product and someone buys it atleast send the one that is advertised.Other than the size it is nice work. I love the light color of the wood.",0
I was just looking online for where to buy replacement batteries and after reading the reviews here I think I'll start looking for a new phone. The batteries on all 3 of our handsets only hold about 30 minutes in call time. We were hoping there was a LION replacement... no luck. Please learn from all these reviews... you'll love the phone until your 1 year warranty runs out and so do all your batteries!,0
"Honestly, there's not a lot to say about this mouse pad... cause its a basic mouse pad, which is what you want. Problem is, the things smells freaking terrible. I've washed it twice and the smell is still pretty bad and stays on my hands after using it. Its cheap, but don't get this product... its not worth it.",0
The stopper is solid and well made. it matches the rest of the brass well. There is an adequate amount of resistance to hold the stoppoer in the up position when it is not being used to hold the door. All necessary mounting hardware was included.,1
I purchased two of the Neoflex LCD stands for use in a public building. They are on monitors that have to be used by many different people. Everyone loves them. It is so easy to adjust the height for each person. The swivel mechanism was an additional plus. I may be buying more.,1
I am very happy with my new checkbook calculator. I have used one for about 40 year and couldn;t be without one. This is probably the best I have ever used.,1
"I suppose this does what it claims to, but it's pretty shoddy. It's basically a thin metal plate (with their silly logo cut out of it in the center) and then a flimsy roundish thing attached at the bottom and a really floppy thing on a hinge at the top. I thought that for $55 I would be getting something that seemed worth $55. This seems more like $15. Returning this was a no-brainer.",0
Bought these to refill my Logo II pencils. They are the good quality rubbery erasers that remove all the lead.Only problem was the shipping--too expensive.,1
"My experiences with this phone have been unpleasant, at best, for the following reasons:1. The mute button causes a perpetual beep, beep in your ear. So, being on mute is a painful experience.2. The message you record is tinny and sounds awful to those who call in. It is very loud as well.3. Programming the phone (after every power blip) takes 5-10 minutes.4. The battery life is horrid. I've replaced the battery and still no improvement.5. There is no handset locator on the remote base.",0
"A $100 printer can't be used right out of the box.... there's no USB cable included. A note on the installation page states ""USB cable purchased separately"". You get it home or have it delivered and then have to go out and buy an insignificant part? If HP were selling cars, would they not include a battery or something else essential? This is a no brainer! I've had many years of good use from an HP LaserJet 6L. Is this Officejet 5610 from a ""new"" HP? Amazon should not allow a sale of this item to be completed without a warning that the USB cable is not included. So, I'm off to a bad start and I've not even printed one page!",0
"According to product manual, ""yellow"" mark means ""real money"", and that what it shows for all the bills I tested. Great for the money.",1
"these are the best colored pencils ive ever used. They blend beautifully, especially if you use the colorless blender. The colors are vibrant, and dont fade. The finished product almost looks like paint because the pigment blends so smoothly into the surface. I would recommend getting the whole set of 132. I started with the 48 and bought individual pencils from there, i dont have all of them...yet. It gives you so much more variety, and you can make your own colors. There are endless possibilites! I'm trying to suggest how to buy individual pencils, but Amazon keeps censoring me! This seller actually sells through Amazon, so I don't know why they are being so hard nosed. Its Dick Blick.",1
I wanted to label my SpiceStack and new spice jars but I didn't want those gummy labels that are impossible to remove. So I searched and found these. They are perfect. I quickly downloaded the template from avery.com and started to work. They are self-adhesive and remove easily. This package will last me a very long time. I have found other things around the house that I can quickly put a quick label on. I think these would be great to label travel bottles.,1
The picture looks like it shows the stylus but the item shown is really the metal refill that goes IN the stylus.The picture may mislead. If you want the stylus don't get this item.,0
"I have always liked Panasonic products. Within a month of purchasing this one, however, I knew I'd made a mistake. The sound quality is terrible, often fading in and out. Interference is a constant problem, which is really regretful for a digital phone. Battery life is short and it doesn't always charge properly. To add insult to injury, within 2 weeks the display stopped working altogether. Just a blank screen. We are a normal family with normal phone use, and this phone couldn't even hold up to that.",0
"My grandson asked for this, for a Christmas present, and we had a marvelous time, Christmas morning, piling coins from Grandpa's jar, into the coin bank. It works beautifully, and it is a great help having the coin tubes along with the bank. It sorts them quickly,feeds them into the coin envelopes, and away you go !! Great fun, and I'm glad we got it.Corinne McGeorge",1
"First, I'm a Mac user and the template download didn't have one labeled for Microsoft version 2008 but 2007 worked just fine. Next, figuring out which way it goes in the printer. Thanks to the handy practice sheet I got it in a couple of tries. Wouldn't it be great if you could put in your printer make and model and it would tell you which way the paper goes. One of the slickest features of Clear Label is being able to apply labels to all five tabs ""at once."" After lining up the tabs and the strip, you can apply them all at once but to remove the remainder of the strip requires a little fiddling with each label... at least they all got positioned perfectly and that's the important point. Maybe they could make them break apart just a little easier.Where you need to follow my directions instead of theirs is if you are applying labels to both sides of each tab. Unlike the example Avery supplies, you don't want to just type the labels two up. For the second set, you'll want to reverse the order. Otherwise you won't be able to take advantage of the ""Easy Apply Label Strip"" and you'll be back to peeling them off one by one and hoping you can line them up. I didn't figure this out on the first batch but it worked well on the second.The end result is a very nice looking set of tabs and knowing they are made from 30% recycled paper helps too... especially when I read today that global climate change has already killed off 40% of the phytoplankton in the Earth's oceans and I happen to know that historically, half of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis. Whatever Avery can do to further cut down or indicate their carbon footprint would be appreciated. I'm sure these labels don't contribute much but every breath may soon count a great deal, especially for our grandchildren.",1
"I used this planner last year, and it was fantastic! So I knew I couldn't go wrong by getting it again. It is a great way to keep me organized and keep my kids on track with their school work.",1
"I bought this to organize my mail, and thats what it does. I hung it by my front door, put unopened mail in one part opened bills in another and coupons in the top. I hang my keys and store plus cards on the hooks. This is a good product and looks great to.",1
"I use The Smart Shopper every day. Since it is magnetic, it hangs conveniently on the refrigerator. If I am out of something, I simply go over to the fridge and push the button and tell it what I need. I will never be without my SmartShopper.",1
"Canon includes a 5 pack sample of this paper with (probably all) the two printers I bought (Canon PIXMA 3000 and PIXMA MP780) and I was so happy that they did. I was able to find 100 pieces of supposedly ""premium"" Picture paper for $5.99 with a $5.99 rebate on some bargain website, but the paper was thin and wouldn't feed properly into the printer (6 months later still no rebate) With this paper, a middle to higher line Canon printer, and some generic ink, you can print pictures that are near perfect without having to wait. This paper is very high quality, it works well with the printers I have. Everyone who sees them, thinks that my photos were professionally developed. I can't see the need for photo paper pro, but if canon/amazon is willing to lower the price or include some in my next order of this, I'd be willing to give it a try.",1
"I had purchased this phone 1 1/2 year ago and then all of the sudden one day, they didn't work. We could get no dial tone. I called the customer service number which instructed me to do a few things ( take batteries out, unplug the main unit, etc) and nothing worked. She then concluded that the base was broken and because it was greater than one year I'd have to purchase another one for $120! I spent over $300 because We had 4 phones total and it stops working after a year!I recently bought the V-tech phone and love it so far! The quality is much better and has nicer features. I like how the name of the person calling and the number appear at the same time unlike the Siemens phone.Siemens customer serivce was not helpful and their products are not worth the money you spend for them.",0
For my birthday I bought an Oberon leather journal and needed a ruled notebook filler. I ordered the Moleskine ruled notebook. The notebook is very well made!,1
"I should've known that $19.99 was too little to pay for a leather planner. While the leather cover itself is nice enough, you should know that the inside is basically an inexpensive, plastic planner with cheap metal rings and pages that are not extremely functional. Every time you open up the planner, the plastic insert inside slides and moves. I'm sending it back (unfortunately with a $5 restocking fee).",0
"The markers were dry. I tried all four markers. I just continued to use the one I already had, which fortunately has not run out. I was able to complete my project.",1
"I'll include a disclaimer that I'm not a professional engineer, architect, or anyone who might be drafting. I found these on a quest to find the perfect pencil, and my search ended here.Initially introduced to me by a professional architect, I was instantly enamored with this line of mechanical drafting pencils. The craftsmanship is wonderful, from the plastics to the metal accents, making it a lustworthy writing implement. The pencil is very lightweight yet feels balanced in your hand, almost weighing down onto the paper when writing and yet lifting as easily as a feather. The metal grip looks as though it may be painful or coarse on your fingertips, but it feels natural, and keeps your pencil fixed in your hand. It feels very sturdy, as though it will last the test of time through all of your usage.Yes, it has the flaw of a delicate metal tip, an overly loose lead indicator, and the spring loaded tip may be an annoyance to professionals (I find that it has actually helped me by preventing me from breaking lead). But they detract nothing from the sheer joy of using this pencil; I completely recommend the Alvin Draft Matic line of pencils. (I have tried the .3mm, .5mm, .7mm, and .9mm pencils, and of those found that the .7mm is by far the best for common application, but still recommend the entire line).",1

"This product works very well for my daughter. It gives her more confidence in her writing ability. She can enter words she is not sure how to spell and it offers her word suggestions. This saves her having to ask friends or her teachers. I can enter her spelling and vocab words each week. She is able to look up definitions right on the dictionary.Great Product. The only drawback would be that sometimes the words she enters, it can not offer her suggestions for; based on the fact that her spelling is not close enough. That can sometimes be frustrating for her.",1
"This is the second Panasonic cordless phone that I have owned. the first one crashed and burned at 10 months and I had a terrible time getting Panasonic to even discuss the problems. I waited several years before buying another Panasonic, and this phone has been worse than the first. The phone simply goes dead within a minute or two of answering or dialing. I have tried replacing the battery, but that made no difference. Quite honestly, I will never buy another Panasonic phone. I feel like a chump for having wasted my money a second time; there's no way I'd do it a third time.",0
"Piece of garbage! That's why I'm on here looking for a new one. The cordless phone half is great, the fax machine blows. Constant missfeeds...have to babysit it. I'm gonna try a sharp.",0
"We bought a 610 about 2 years ago and can quite decidely say it's the worse and most expensive piece of #@$%& that we have ever had the misfortune to deal with. For starters, the size of the cartridges was a bit of a shock, as it has to be the smallest cartridge that HP put together, their old 190, 170, and 310 cartridges are at least 2 or 3 times the size of this one. That in itself wouldn't be so bad but you have to use genuine HP cartridges that cost around 60-70 dollars a set, HP puts a small chip on their cartridge that makes it extremely hard to use third party ink supplies. They oughta be sued for that nasty little trick. And to add insult to injury the cartridges have a very short expiration date, even if you use them lightly, the machine pops up with ""Replace cartridges"" error message, after just a couple months! And don't forget the printheads, they have their own built in expiration date, you have the same story there, for about $120 per set.So after the initial dismay we got over it and after about 2 months it wouldn't do a thing, just sat there and said ""replace printheads"". We shelled out and replaced and had the same story. So we called up the merry-go-round that passes for HP tech support and guess what, they stink even worse than the machine they support. I knew India has a bad rep when it comes to quality, but the techs can't even speak proper english, and their communication is absolutely awful, it sounds like they're speaking from inside a pail or barrel. But we DID get it replaced finally and the new one did the same thing, after a month or two, PLUS we have to reset it every time it gets tired of working. Also, the bottom is soaked with ink for some reason, probably a leak or something, making a terrible mess. We have since got a different machine and this one isn't used much now, anymore it basically sits there ticking me off every time I look at it. In conclusion, we've spent close to $300 after the purchase price and I think it's the worse (and the most expensive) disappointment HP ever made, not at all the legendary HP quality we're used to, especially not for $500. I know in the future I will avoid HP all-in-ones like the plague.",0
"We have used VTech phones for years with excellent performance. However, this model/unit was a terrible disappointment. The answering machine base unit failed within 1 month after purchase. The handset is not compatible with other VT2400 series model base units, so we can't use it with our other base. Go ahead and get a VTech system, just not this one.",0
"My institution has some odd restrictions on calculators, they like to make sure students have the mental abilities to perform and have banned graphing calculators for chemistry. Struggling with cheap non-graphing calculators I asked my favorite professor what non-graphing calculator I should get for chemistry and he told me, ""Get the HP 33 and thank me later.""I did thank him later. There is a reason these things go for twice as much on Ebay.There was a visiting PhD in my class last week and he noticed my HP 33 and commented that I must be a serious student to have such a quality calculator.If you have to do any work that requires precise sig. figs., this is your beast. Yes, I know, anyone can track sig. figs. by hand without much effort. Most errors in high math and chemistry come down to misplaced decimal places, why wouldn't you want a calculator that can function completely in scientific notation?If you're like me, and you can't track 2.36x10^24 + 5.34x10^21 in your head, get an HP 33. You will have many moments where you go to work on a problem in a group and and your HP 33 will solve the problem in half the keystrokes of a TI-86 and people will say, ""Your calculator does what?! Where do I get one?!""Also, read the manual. Reverse Polish is nothing like a normal calculator, don't be intimidated! Just sit down and read the manual and complete the provided sample problems and eventually the light bulb goes on in your head. After that, you won't be able to function without your HP 33 and you'll start snickering at all those TI folks who are still punching in parentheses while you're onto the next question.",1
I received the bookstand today. Would have given it 5 star rating had the finish not looked more walnut than honey.,1
"We bought this phone yesterday and are returning it today. There ample features, the phone is sleek and the size compact but THAT IS NOT THE POINT. All you want a cordless to do is have good voice quality and battery life. I can't speak for the battery life (Consumer Reports states 13 hours but they also reported good voice quality, so go figure) but the voice quality is poooooor. Granted we live in an apartment and there may be alot of interference but I can't justify spending $... for a phone that does not handle the basics. White noise in every conversation and the answering machine message is inaudible. Going to give the Panasonic 2730s and will write a review for that one as well.Trust me. . . Don't buy this phone unless you want ...",0
"Got this thinking it was a great deal, and the scale itself worked pretty well, until the AC adapter failed due to a very poor design. The L-shaped plug from the adapter into the scale base protrudes below the bottom of the scale rather than being properly made to fit in the recess in the base. That means the whole time the adapter it is plugged into the base, the cord is bent at a 90-degree angle underneath it, and in a short period of time it WILL break. There is no way to position the plug-in connector so it does not protrude from the bottom, due to its faulty elbow design(instead of a straight plug-in which would be protected by the recess.) So I am stuck going through 9V batteries to use the scale. I guess they got a great deal on a batch of ill-fitting transformers and decided who cares about quality and functionality. Get the scale if you don't mind running 100% on batteries after a short time.",0
"I was having trouble with another product I found on line and it left me somewhat afraid to buy anything else but I needed this equipment so I could work. I emailed Dave, the owner, and asked if I could call him. I think he was hesitant but said yes. After I called him and relayed my past bad situation, he understood and actually he mailed it to me, at his cost, overnight so I could get back to work quickly. He was very nice and the transaction went very smooth. Dave did go out of his way for me and I will always appreciate that. I will always give him a 5 star rating.Donna Brown",1
"I bought this phone set as a gift for my parents. It is excellent! My parents are hard of hearing, but the voice volume is terrific and they can actually hear what people say with these phones. The phones features are pretty easy to use and program, even without reading the owners manual.",1
The item is a regular reorder of ink refills that I use a lot. I am satisfied with them or I wouldn't continue to use them. Arrived quickly and in good packaging.,1
"The calculators I ordered arrived quickly, so I am pleased with the prompt delivery. I was surprised as to how small they were, though. I was expecting them to be quite a bit larger. They work well, which is most important, and I will buy more of these if needed.",1
2 months since I bought this and so far so good. Container is big enough to hold a good amount of paper.UPDATE 1-1-2010Still works great! Buy it today! :),1
